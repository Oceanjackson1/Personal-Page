# Scientific Slides

## Overview

Scientific presentations are a critical medium for communicating research, sharing findings, and engaging with academic and professional audiences. This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating effective scientific presentations, from structure and content development to visual design and delivery preparation.

**Key Focus**: Oral presentations for conferences, seminars, defenses, and professional talks.

**CRITICAL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**: Scientific presentations should be VISUALLY ENGAGING and RESEARCH-BACKED. Avoid dry, text-heavy slides at all costs. Great scientific presentations combine:
- **Compelling visuals**: High-quality figures, images, diagrams (not just bullet points)
- **Research context**: Proper citations from research-lookup establishing credibility
- **Minimal text**: Bullet points as prompts, YOU provide the explanation verbally
- **Professional design**: Modern color schemes, strong visual hierarchy, generous white space
- **Story-driven**: Clear narrative arc, not just data dumps

**Remember**: Boring presentations = forgotten science. Make your slides visually memorable while maintaining scientific rigor through proper citations.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Preparing conference presentations (5-20 minutes)
- Developing academic seminars (45-60 minutes)
- Creating thesis or dissertation defense presentations
- Designing grant pitch presentations
- Preparing journal club presentations
- Giving research talks at institutions or companies
- Teaching or tutorial presentations on scientific topics

## Slide Generation with Nano Banana Pro

**This skill uses Nano Banana Pro AI to generate stunning presentation slides automatically.**

There are two workflows depending on output format:

### Default Workflow: PDF Slides (Recommended)

Generate each slide as a complete image using Nano Banana Pro, then combine into a PDF. This produces the most visually stunning results.

**How it works:**
1. **Plan the deck**: Create a detailed plan for each slide (title, key points, visual elements)
2. **Generate slides**: Call Nano Banana Pro for each slide to create complete slide images
3. **Combine to PDF**: Assemble slide images into a single PDF presentation

**Step 1: Plan Each Slide**

Before generating, create a detailed plan for your presentation:

```markdown
# Presentation Plan: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Slide 1: Title Slide
- Title: "Machine Learning: From Theory to Practice"
- Subtitle: "AI Conference 2025"
- Speaker: Dr. Jane Smith, University of XYZ
- Visual: Modern abstract neural network background

## Slide 2: Introduction
- Title: "Why Machine Learning Matters"
- Key points: Industry adoption, breakthrough applications, future potential
- Visual: Icons showing different ML applications (healthcare, finance, robotics)

## Slide 3: Core Concepts
- Title: "The Three Types of Learning"
- Content: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement
- Visual: Three-part diagram showing each type with examples

... (continue for all slides)
```

**Step 2: Generate Each Slide**

Use the `generate_slide_image.py` script to create each slide.

**CRITICAL: Formatting Consistency Protocol**

To ensure unified formatting across all slides in a presentation:

1. **Define a Formatting Goal** at the start of your presentation and include it in EVERY prompt:
   - Color scheme (e.g., "dark blue background, white text, gold accents")
   - Typography style (e.g., "bold sans-serif titles, clean body text")
   - Visual style (e.g., "minimal, professional, corporate aesthetic")
   - Layout approach (e.g., "generous white space, left-aligned content")

2. **Always attach the previous slide** when generating subsequent slides using `--attach`:
   - This allows Nano Banana Pro to see and match the existing style
   - Creates visual continuity throughout the deck
   - Ensures consistent colors, fonts, and design language

3. **Default author is "K-Dense"** unless another name is specified

4. **Include citations directly in the prompt** for slides that reference research:
   - Add citations in the prompt text so they appear on the generated slide
   - Use format: "Include citation: (Author et al., Year)" or "Show reference: Author et al., Year"
   - For multiple citations, list them all in the prompt
   - Citations should appear in small text at the bottom of the slide or near relevant content

5. **Attach existing figures/data for results slides** (CRITICAL for data-driven presentations):
   - When creating slides about results, ALWAYS check for existing figures in:
     - The working directory (e.g., `figures/`, `results/`, `plots/`, `images/`)
     - User-provided input files or directories
     - Any data visualizations, charts, or graphs relevant to the presentation
   - Use `--attach` to include these figures so Nano Banana Pro can incorporate them:
     - Attach the actual data figure/chart for results slides
     - Attach relevant diagrams for methodology slides
     - Attach logos or institutional images for title slides
   - When attaching data figures, describe what you want in the prompt:
     - "Create a slide presenting the attached results chart with key findings highlighted"
     - "Build a slide around this attached figure, add title and bullet points explaining the data"
     - "Incorporate the attached graph into a results slide with interpretation"
   - **Before generating results slides**: List files in the working directory to find relevant figures
   - Multiple figures can be attached: `--attach fig1.png --attach fig2.png`

**Example with formatting consistency, citations, and figure attachments:**

```bash
# Title slide (first slide - establishes the style)
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Title slide for presentation: 'Machine Learning: From Theory to Practice'. Subtitle: 'AI Conference 2025'. Speaker: K-Dense. FORMATTING GOAL: Dark blue background (#1a237e), white text, gold accents (#ffc107), minimal design, sans-serif fonts, generous margins, no decorative elements." -o slides/01_title.png

# Content slide with citations (attach previous slide for consistency)
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Presentation slide titled 'Why Machine Learning Matters'. Three key points with simple icons: 1) Industry adoption, 2) Breakthrough applications, 3) Future potential. CITATIONS: Include at bottom in small text: (LeCun et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2016). FORMATTING GOAL: Match attached slide style - dark blue background, white text, gold accents, minimal professional design, no visual clutter." -o slides/02_intro.png --attach slides/01_title.png

# Background slide with multiple citations
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Presentation slide titled 'Deep Learning Revolution'. Key milestones: ImageNet breakthrough (2012), transformer architecture (2017), GPT models (2018-present). CITATIONS: Show references at bottom: (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020). FORMATTING GOAL: Match attached slide style exactly - same colors, fonts, minimal design." -o slides/03_background.png --attach slides/02_intro.png

# RESULTS SLIDE - Attach actual data figure from working directory
# First, check what figures exist: ls figures/ or ls results/
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Presentation slide titled 'Model Performance Results'. Create a slide presenting the attached accuracy chart. Key findings to highlight: 1) 95% accuracy achieved, 2) Outperforms baseline by 12%, 3) Consistent across test sets. CITATIONS: Include at bottom: (Our results, 2025). FORMATTING GOAL: Match attached slide style exactly." -o slides/04_results.png --attach slides/03_background.png --attach figures/accuracy_chart.png

# RESULTS SLIDE - Multiple figures comparison
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Presentation slide titled 'Before vs After Comparison'. Build a side-by-side comparison slide using the two attached figures. Left: baseline results, Right: our improved results. Add brief labels explaining the improvement. FORMATTING GOAL: Match attached slide style exactly." -o slides/05_comparison.png --attach slides/04_results.png --attach figures/baseline.png --attach figures/improved.png

# METHODOLOGY SLIDE - Attach existing diagram
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Presentation slide titled 'System Architecture'. Present the attached architecture diagram with brief explanatory bullet points: 1) Input processing, 2) Model inference, 3) Output generation. FORMATTING GOAL: Match attached slide style exactly." -o slides/06_architecture.png --attach slides/05_comparison.png --attach diagrams/system_architecture.png
```

**IMPORTANT: Before creating results slides, always:**
1. List files in working directory: `ls -la figures/` or `ls -la results/`
2. Check user-provided directories for relevant figures
3. Attach ALL relevant figures that should appear on the slide
4. Describe how Nano Banana Pro should incorporate the attached figures

**Prompt Template:**

Include these elements in every prompt (customize as needed):
```
[Slide content description]
CITATIONS: Include at bottom: (Author1 et al., Year; Author2 et al., Year)
FORMATTING GOAL: [Background color], [text color], [accent color], minimal professional design, no decorative elements, consistent with attached slide style.
```

**Step 3: Combine to PDF**

```bash
# Combine all slides into a PDF presentation
python scripts/slides_to_pdf.py slides/*.png -o presentation.pdf
```

### PPT Workflow: PowerPoint with Generated Visuals

When creating PowerPoint presentations, use Nano Banana Pro to generate images and figures for each slide, then add text separately using the PPTX skill.

**How it works:**
1. **Plan the deck**: Create content plan for each slide
2. **Generate visuals**: Use Nano Banana Pro with `--visual-only` flag to create images for slides
3. **Build PPTX**: Use the PPTX skill (html2pptx or template-based) to create slides with generated visuals and separate text

**Step 1: Generate Visuals for Each Slide**

```bash
# Generate a figure for the introduction slide
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Professional illustration showing machine learning applications: healthcare diagnosis, financial analysis, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Modern flat design, colorful icons on white background." -o figures/ml_applications.png --visual-only

# Generate a diagram for the methods slide
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Neural network architecture diagram showing input layer, three hidden layers, and output layer. Clean, technical style with node connections. Blue and gray color scheme." -o figures/neural_network.png --visual-only

# Generate a conceptual graphic for results
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Before and after comparison showing improvement: left side shows cluttered data, right side shows organized insights. Arrow connecting them. Professional business style." -o figures/results_visual.png --visual-only
```

**Step 2: Build PowerPoint with PPTX Skill**

Use the PPTX skill's html2pptx workflow to create slides that include:
- Generated images from step 1
- Title and body text added separately
- Professional layout and formatting

See `document-skills/pptx/SKILL.md` for complete PPTX creation documentation.

## Nano Banana Pro Script Reference

### generate_slide_image.py

Generate presentation slides or visuals using Nano Banana Pro AI.

```bash
# Full slide (default) - generates complete slide as image
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "slide description" -o output.png

# Visual only - generates just the image/figure for embedding in PPT
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "visual description" -o output.png --visual-only

# With reference images attached (Nano Banana Pro will see these)
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Create a slide explaining this chart" -o slide.png --attach chart.png
python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Combine these into a comparison slide" -o compare.png --attach before.png --attach after.png
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output`: Output file path (required)
- `--attach IMAGE`: Attach image file(s) as context for generation (can use multiple times)
- `--visual-only`: Generate just the visual/figure, not a complete slide

- `--api-key`: OpenRouter API key (or set OPENROUTER_API_KEY env var)
- `-v, --verbose`: Verbose output

**Attaching Reference Images:**

Use `--attach` when you want Nano Banana Pro to see existing images as context:
- "Create a slide about this data" + attach the data chart
- "Make a title slide with this logo" + attach the logo
- "Combine these figures into one slide" + attach multiple images
- "Explain this diagram in a slide" + attach the diagram

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
# Get key at: https://openrouter.ai/keys
```

### slides_to_pdf.py

Combine multiple slide images into a single PDF.

```bash
# Combine PNG files
python scripts/slides_to_pdf.py slides/*.png -o presentation.pdf

# Combine specific files in order
python scripts/slides_to_pdf.py title.png intro.png methods.png -o talk.pdf

# From directory (sorted by filename)
python scripts/slides_to_pdf.py slides/ -o presentation.pdf
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output`: Output PDF path (required)
- `--dpi`: PDF resolution (default: 150)

## Prompt Writing for Slide Generation

### Full Slide Prompts (PDF Workflow)

For complete slides, include:
1. **Slide type**: Title slide, content slide, diagram slide, etc.
2. **Title**: The slide title text
3. **Content**: Key points, bullet items, or descriptions
4. **Visual elements**: What imagery, icons, or graphics to include
5. **Design style**: Color scheme, mood, aesthetic

**Example prompts:**

```
Title slide:
"Title slide for a medical research presentation. Title: 'Advances in Cancer Immunotherapy'. Subtitle: 'Clinical Trial Results 2024'. Professional medical theme with subtle DNA helix in background. Navy blue and white color scheme."

Content slide:
"Presentation slide titled 'Key Findings'. Three bullet points: 1) 40% improvement in response rate, 2) Reduced side effects, 3) Extended survival outcomes. Include relevant medical icons. Clean, professional design with green and white colors."

Diagram slide:
"Presentation slide showing the research methodology. Title: 'Study Design'. Flowchart showing: Patient Screening → Randomization → Treatment Groups (A, B, Control) → Follow-up → Analysis. CONSORT-style flow diagram. Professional academic style."
```

### Visual-Only Prompts (PPT Workflow)

For images to embed in PowerPoint, focus on the visual element only:

```
"Flowchart showing machine learning pipeline: Data Collection → Preprocessing → Model Training → Validation → Deployment. Clean technical style, blue and gray colors."

"Conceptual illustration of cloud computing with servers, data flow, and connected devices. Modern flat design, suitable for business presentation."

"Scientific diagram of cell division process showing mitosis phases. Educational style with labels, colorblind-friendly colors."
```

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

In addition to slide generation, use the **scientific-schematics** skill for technical diagrams:

**When to use scientific-schematics instead:**
- Complex technical diagrams (circuit diagrams, chemical structures)
- Publication-quality figures for papers (higher quality threshold)
- Diagrams requiring scientific accuracy review

**How to generate schematics:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o figures/output.png
```

For detailed guidance on creating schematics, refer to the scientific-schematics skill documentation.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Presentation Structure and Organization

Build presentations with clear narrative flow and appropriate structure for different contexts. For detailed guidance, refer to `references/presentation_structure.md`.

**Universal Story Arc**:
1. **Hook**: Grab attention (30-60 seconds)
2. **Context**: Establish importance (5-10% of talk)
3. **Problem/Gap**: Identify what's unknown (5-10% of talk)
4. **Approach**: Explain your solution (15-25% of talk)
5. **Results**: Present key findings (40-50% of talk)
6. **Implications**: Discuss meaning (15-20% of talk)
7. **Closure**: Memorable conclusion (1-2 minutes)

**Talk-Specific Structures**:
- **Conference talks (15 min)**: Focused on 1-2 key findings, minimal methods
- **Academic seminars (45 min)**: Comprehensive coverage, detailed methods, multiple studies
- **Thesis defenses (60 min)**: Complete dissertation overview, all studies covered
- **Grant pitches (15 min)**: Emphasis on significance, feasibility, and impact
- **Journal clubs (30 min)**: Critical analysis of published work

### 2. Slide Design Principles

Create professional, readable, and accessible slides that enhance understanding. For complete design guidelines, refer to `references/slide_design_principles.md`.

**ANTI-PATTERN: Avoid Dry, Text-Heavy Presentations**

❌ **What Makes Presentations Dry and Forgettable:**
- Walls of text (more than 6 bullets per slide)
- Small fonts (<24pt body text)
- Black text on white background only (no visual interest)
- No images or graphics (bullet points only)
- Generic templates with no customization
- Dense, paragraph-like bullet points
- Missing research context (no citations)
- All slides look the same (repetitive)

✅ **What Makes Presentations Engaging and Memorable:**
- HIGH-QUALITY VISUALS dominate (figures, photos, diagrams, icons)
- Large, clear text as accent (not the main content)
- Modern, purposeful color schemes (not default themes)
- Generous white space (slides breathe)
- Research-backed context (proper citations from research-lookup)
- Variety in slide layouts (not all bullet lists)
- Story-driven flow with visual anchors
- Professional, polished appearance

**Core Design Principles**:

**Visual-First Approach** (CRITICAL):
- Start with visuals (figures, images, diagrams), add text as support
- Every slide should have STRONG visual element (figure, chart, photo, diagram)
- Text explains or complements visuals, not replaces them
- Think: "How can I show this, not just tell it?"
- Target: 60-70% visual content, 30-40% text

**Simplicity with Impact**:
- One main idea per slide
- MINIMAL text (3-4 bullets, 4-6 words each preferred)
- Generous white space (40-50% of slide)
- Clear visual focus
- Bold, confident design choices

**Typography for Engagement**:
- Sans-serif fonts (Arial, Calibri, Helvetica)
- LARGE fonts: 24-28pt for body text (not minimum 18pt)
- 36-44pt for slide titles (make bold)
- High contrast (minimum 4.5:1, prefer 7:1)
- Use size for hierarchy, not just weight

**Color for Impact**:
- MODERN color palettes (not default blue/gray)
- Consider your topic: biotech? vibrant colors. Physics? sleek darks. Health? warm tones.
- Limited palette (3-5 colors total)
- High contrast combinations
- Color-blind safe (avoid red-green combinations)
- Use color purposefully (not decoration)

**Layout for Visual Interest**:
- Vary layouts (not all bullet lists)
- Use two-column layouts (text + figure)
- Full-slide figures for key results
- Asymmetric compositions (more interesting than centered)
- Rule of thirds for focal points
- Consistent but not repetitive

### 3. Data Visualization for Slides

Adapt scientific figures for presentation context. For detailed guidance, refer to `references/data_visualization_slides.md`.

**Key Differences from Journal Figures**:
- Simplify, don't replicate
- Larger fonts (18-24pt minimum)
- Fewer panels (split across slides)
- Direct labeling (not legends)
- Emphasis through color and size
- Progressive disclosure for complex data

**Visualization Best Practices**:
- **Bar charts**: Comparing discrete categories
- **Line graphs**: Trends and trajectories
- **Scatter plots**: Relationships and correlations
- **Heatmaps**: Matrix data and patterns
- **Network diagrams**: Relationships and connections

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Tiny fonts (<18pt)
- Too many panels on one slide
- Complex legends
- Insufficient contrast
- Cluttered layouts

### 4. Talk-Specific Guidance

Different presentation contexts require different approaches. For comprehensive guidance on each type, refer to `references/talk_types_guide.md`.

**Conference Talks** (10-20 minutes):
- Structure: Brief intro → minimal methods → key results → quick conclusion
- Focus: 1-2 main findings only
- Style: Engaging, fast-paced, memorable
- Goal: Generate interest, network, get invited

**Academic Seminars** (45-60 minutes):
- Structure: Comprehensive coverage with detailed methods
- Focus: Multiple findings, depth of analysis
- Style: Scholarly, interactive, discussion-oriented
- Goal: Demonstrate expertise, get feedback, collaborate

**Thesis Defenses** (45-60 minutes):
- Structure: Complete dissertation overview, all studies
- Focus: Demonstrating mastery and independent thinking
- Style: Formal, comprehensive, prepared for interrogation
- Goal: Pass examination, defend research decisions

**Grant Pitches** (10-20 minutes):
- Structure: Problem → significance → approach → feasibility → impact
- Focus: Innovation, preliminary data, team qualifications
- Style: Persuasive, focused on outcomes and impact
- Goal: Secure funding, demonstrate viability

**Journal Clubs** (20-45 minutes):
- Structure: Context → methods → results → critical analysis
- Focus: Understanding and critiquing published work
- Style: Educational, critical, discussion-facilitating
- Goal: Learn, critique, discuss implications

- Beamer: Compile LaTeX source

**Step 2: Convert to Images**
```bash
# Using the pdf_to_images script
python scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf review/slide --dpi 150

# Or use pptx skill's thumbnail tool
python ../document-skills/pptx/scripts/thumbnail.py presentation.pptx review/thumb
```

**Step 3: Systematic Inspection**

Check each slide for:
- **Text overflow**: Text cut off at edges
- **Element overlap**: Text overlapping images or other text
- **Font sizes**: Text too small (<18pt)
- **Contrast**: Insufficient contrast between text and background
- **Layout issues**: Misalignment, poor spacing
- **Visual quality**: Pixelated images, poor rendering

**Step 4: Document Issues**

Create issue log:
```
Slide # | Issue Type | Description | Priority
--------|-----------|-------------|----------
3       | Text overflow | Bullet 4 extends beyond box | High
7       | Overlap | Figure overlaps with caption | High
12      | Font size | Axis labels too small | Medium
```

**Step 5: Apply Fixes**

Make corrections to source files:
- PowerPoint: Edit text boxes, resize elements
- Beamer: Adjust LaTeX code, recompile

**Step 6: Re-Validate**

Repeat Steps 1-5 until no critical issues remain.

**Stopping Criteria**:
- No text overflow
- No inappropriate overlaps
- All text readable (≥18pt equivalent)
- Adequate contrast (≥4.5:1)
- Professional appearance

### 7. Timing and Pacing

Ensure presentations fit allocated time. For comprehensive timing guidance, refer to `assets/timing_guidelines.md`.

**The One-Slide-Per-Minute Rule**:
- General guideline: ~1 slide per minute
- Adjust for complex slides (2-3 minutes)
- Adjust for simple slides (15-30 seconds)

**Time Allocation**:
- Introduction: 15-20%
- Methods: 15-20%
- Results: 40-50% (MOST TIME)
- Discussion: 15-20%
- Conclusion: 5%

**Practice Requirements**:
- 5-minute talk: Practice 5-7 times
- 15-minute talk: Practice 3-5 times
- 45-minute talk: Practice 3-4 times
- Defense: Practice 4-6 times

**Timing Checkpoints**:

For 15-minute talk:
- 3-4 minutes: Finishing introduction
- 7-8 minutes: Halfway through results
- 12-13 minutes: Starting conclusions

**Emergency Strategies**:
- Running behind: Skip backup slides (prepare in advance)
- Running ahead: Expand examples, slow slightly
- Never skip conclusions

### 8. Validation and Quality Assurance

**Automated Validation**:
```bash
# Validate slide count, timing, file size
python scripts/validate_presentation.py presentation.pdf --duration 15

# Generates report on:
# - Slide count vs. recommended range
# - File size warnings
# - Slide dimensions
# - Font size issues (PowerPoint)
# - Compilation success (Beamer)
```

**Manual Validation Checklist**:

## Workflow for Presentation Development

### Stage 1: Planning (Before Creating Slides)

**Define Context**:
1. What type of talk? (Conference, seminar, defense, etc.)
2. How long? (Duration in minutes)
3. Who is the audience? (Specialists, general, mixed)
4. What's the venue? (Room size, A/V setup, virtual/in-person)
5. What happens after? (Q&A, discussion, networking)

**Research and Literature Review** (Use research-lookup skill):
1. **Search for background literature**: Find 5-10 key papers establishing context
2. **Identify knowledge gaps**: Use research-lookup to find what's unknown
3. **Locate comparison studies**: Find papers with similar methods or results
4. **Gather supporting citations**: Collect papers supporting your interpretations
5. **Build reference list**: Create .bib file or citation list for slides
6. **Note key findings to cite**: Document specific results to reference

**Develop Content Outline**:
1. Identify 1-3 core messages
2. Select key findings to present
3. Choose essential figures (typically 3-6 for 15-min talk)
4. Plan narrative arc with proper citations
5. Allocate time by section

**Example Outline for 15-Minute Talk**:
```
1. Title (30 sec)
2. Hook: Compelling problem (60 sec) [Cite 1-2 papers via research-lookup]
3. Background (90 sec) [Cite 3-4 key papers establishing context]
4. Research question (45 sec) [Cite papers showing gap]
5. Methods overview (2 min)
6-8. Main result 1 (3 min, 3 slides)
9-10. Main result 2 (2 min, 2 slides)
11-12. Result 3 or validation (2 min, 2 slides)
13-14. Discussion and implications (2 min) [Compare to 2-3 prior studies]
15. Conclusions (45 sec)
16. Acknowledgments (15 sec)

NOTE: Use research-lookup to find papers for background (slides 2-4) 
and discussion (slides 13-14) BEFORE creating slides.
```

### Stage 2: Design and Creation

**Choose Implementation Method**:

**Option A: PowerPoint (via PPTX skill)**
1. Read `assets/powerpoint_design_guide.md`
2. Read `document-skills/pptx/SKILL.md`
3. Choose approach (programmatic or template-based)
4. Create master slides with consistent design
5. Build presentation following outline

**Option B: LaTeX Beamer**
1. Read `references/beamer_guide.md`
2. Select appropriate template from `assets/`
3. Customize theme and colors
4. Write content in LaTeX
5. Compile to PDF

**Design Considerations** (Make It Visually Appealing):
- **Select MODERN color palette**: Match your topic (biotech=vibrant, physics=sleek, health=warm)
  - Use pptx skill's color palette examples (Teal & Coral, Bold Red, Deep Purple & Emerald, etc.)
  - NOT just default blue/gray themes
  - 3-5 colors with high contrast
- **Choose clean fonts**: Sans-serif, large sizes (24pt+ body)
- **Plan visual elements**: What images, diagrams, icons for each slide?
- **Create varied layouts**: Mix full-figure, two-column, text-overlay (not all bullets)
- **Design section dividers**: Visual breaks with striking graphics
- **Plan animations/builds**: Control information flow for complex slides
- **Add visual interest**: Background images, color blocks, shapes, icons

### Stage 3: Content Development

**Populate Slides** (Visual-First Strategy):
1. **Start with visuals**: Plan which figures, images, diagrams for each key point
2. **Use research-lookup extensively**: Find 8-15 papers for proper citations
3. **Create visual backbone first**: Add all figures, charts, images, diagrams
4. **Add minimal text as support**: Bullet points complement visuals, don't replace them
5. **Design section dividers**: Visual breaks with images or graphics (not just text)
6. **Polish title/closing**: Make visually striking, include contact info
7. **Add transitions/builds**: Control information flow

**VISUAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS** (Make Slides Engaging):
- **Images**: Use high-quality photos, illustrations, conceptual graphics
- **Icons**: Visual representations of concepts (not decoration)
- **Diagrams**: Flowcharts, schematics, process diagrams
- **Figures**: Simplified research figures with LARGE labels (18-24pt)
- **Charts**: Clean data visualizations with clear messages
- **Graphics**: Visual metaphors, conceptual illustrations
- **Color blocks**: Use colored shapes to organize content visually
- Target: MINIMUM 1-2 strong visual elements per slide

**Scientific Content** (Research-Backed):
- **Citations**: Use research-lookup EXTENSIVELY to find relevant papers
  - Introduction: Cite 3-5 papers establishing context and gap
  - Background: Show key prior work visually (not just cite)
  - Discussion: Cite 3-5 papers for comparison with your results
  - Use author-year format (Smith et al., 2023) for readability
  - Citations establish credibility and scientific rigor
- **Figures**: Simplified from papers, LARGE labels (18-24pt minimum)
- **Equations**: Large, clear, explain each term (use sparingly)
- **Tables**: Minimal, highlight key comparisons (not data dumps)
- **Code/Algorithms**: Use syntax highlighting, keep brief

**Text Guidelines** (Less is More):
- Bullet points, NEVER paragraphs
- 3-4 bullets per slide (max 6 only if essential)
- 4-6 words per bullet (shorter than 6×6 rule)
- Key terms in bold
- Text is SUPPORTING ROLE, visuals are stars
- Use builds to control pacing

### Stage 4: Visual Validation

**Generate Images**:
```bash
# Convert PDF to images
python scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf review/slides

# Or create thumbnail grid
python ../document-skills/pptx/scripts/thumbnail.py presentation.pptx review/grid
```

**Systematic Review**:
1. View each slide image
2. Check against issue checklist
3. Document problems with slide numbers
4. Test readability from distance (view at 50% size)

**Common Issues to Fix**:
- Text extending beyond boundaries
- Figures overlapping with text
- Font sizes too small
- Poor contrast
- Misalignment

**Iteration**:
1. Fix identified issues in source
2. Regenerate PDF/presentation
3. Convert to images again
4. Re-inspect
5. Repeat until clean

### Stage 5: Practice and Refinement

**Practice Schedule**:
- Run 1: Rough draft (will run long)
- Run 2: Smooth transitions
- Run 3: Exact timing
- Run 4: Final polish
- Run 5+: Maintenance (day before, morning of)

**What to Practice**:
- Full talk with timer
- Difficult explanations
- Transitions between sections
- Opening and closing (until flawless)
- Anticipated questions

**Refinement Based on Practice**:
- Cut slides if running over
- Expand explanations if unclear
- Adjust wording for clarity
- Mark timing checkpoints
- Prepare backup slides

### Stage 6: Final Preparation

**Technical Checks**:
- [ ] Multiple copies saved (laptop, cloud, USB)
- [ ] Works on presentation computer
- [ ] Adapters/cables available
- [ ] Backup PDF version
- [ ] Tested with projector (if possible)

**Content Final**:

- Reference html2pptx for programmatic creation

**Data Visualization**:
- Create presentation-appropriate figures
- Simplify complex visualizations
- Ensure readability from distance
- Use progressive disclosure

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Content Mistakes

**Dry, Boring Presentations** (CRITICAL TO AVOID):
- Problem: Text-heavy slides with no visual interest, missing research context
- Signs: All bullet points, no images, default templates, no citations
- Solution: 
  - Use research-lookup to find 8-15 papers for credible context
  - Add high-quality visuals to EVERY slide (figures, photos, diagrams, icons)
  - Choose modern color palette reflecting your topic
  - Vary slide layouts (not all bullet lists)
  - Tell a story with visuals, use text sparingly

**Too Much Content**:
- Problem: Trying to include everything from paper
- Solution: Focus on 1-2 key findings for short talks, show visually

**Too Much Text**:
- Problem: Full paragraphs on slides, dense bullet points, reading verbatim
- Solution: 3-4 bullets with 4-6 words each, let visuals carry the message

**Missing Research Context**:
- Problem: No citations, claims without support, unclear positioning
- Solution: Use research-lookup to find papers, cite 3-5 in intro, 3-5 in discussion

**Poor Narrative**:
- Problem: Jumping between topics, no clear story, no flow
- Solution: Follow story arc, use visual transitions, maintain thread

**Rushing Through Results**:
- Problem: Brief methods, brief results, long discussion
- Solution: Spend 40-50% of time on results, show data visually

### Design Mistakes

**Generic, Default Appearance**:
- Problem: Using default PowerPoint/Beamer themes without customization, looks dated
- Solution: Choose modern color palette, customize fonts/layouts, add visual personality

**Text-Heavy, Visual-Poor**:
- Problem: All bullet point slides, no images or graphics, boring to look at
- Solution: Add figures, photos, diagrams, icons to EVERY slide, make visually interesting

**Small Fonts**:
- Problem: Body text <18pt, unreadable from back, looks unprofessional
- Solution: 24-28pt for body (not just 18pt minimum), 36-44pt for titles

**Low Contrast**:
- Problem: Light text on light background, poor visibility, hard to read
- Solution: High contrast (7:1 preferred, not just 4.5:1 minimum), test with contrast checker

**Cluttered Slides**:
- Problem: Too many elements, no white space, overwhelming
- Solution: One idea per slide, 40-50% white space, generous spacing

**Inconsistent Formatting**:
- Problem: Different fonts, colors, layouts slide-to-slide, looks amateurish
- Solution: Use master slides, maintain design system, professional consistency

**Missing Visual Hierarchy**:
- Problem: Everything same size and color, no emphasis, unclear focus
- Solution: Size differences (titles large, body medium), color for emphasis, clear focal point

### Timing Mistakes

**Not Practicing**:
- Problem: First time through is during presentation
- Solution: Practice minimum 3 times with timer

**No Time Checkpoints**:
- Problem: Don't realize running behind until too late
- Solution: Set 3-4 checkpoints, monitor throughout

**Going Over Time**:
- Problem: Extremely unprofessional, cuts into Q&A
- Solution: Practice to exact time, prepare Plan B (slides to skip)

**Skipping Conclusions**:
- Problem: Running out of time, rush through or skip ending
- Solution: Never skip conclusions, cut earlier content instead

## Quick Start Guide

### For a 15-Minute Conference Talk (PDF Workflow - Recommended)

1. **Research & Plan** (45 minutes):
   - **Use research-lookup** to find 8-12 relevant papers for citations
   - Build reference list (background, comparison studies)
   - Outline content (intro → methods → 2-3 key results → conclusion)
   - **Create detailed plan for each slide** (title, key points, visual elements)
   - Target 15-18 slides

2. **Generate Slides with Nano Banana Pro** (1-2 hours):
   
   **Important: Use consistent formatting, attach previous slides, and include citations!**
   
   ```bash
   # Title slide (establishes style - default author: K-Dense)
   python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Title slide: 'Your Research Title'. Conference name, K-Dense. FORMATTING GOAL: [your color scheme], minimal professional design, no decorative elements, clean and corporate." -o slides/01_title.png
   
   # Introduction slide with citations (attach previous for consistency)
   python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Slide titled 'Why This Matters'. Three key points with simple icons. CITATIONS: Include at bottom: (Smith et al., 2023; Jones et al., 2024). FORMATTING GOAL: Match attached slide style exactly." -o slides/02_intro.png --attach slides/01_title.png
   
   # Continue for each slide (always attach previous, include citations where relevant)
   python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "Slide titled 'Methods'. Key methodology points. CITATIONS: (Based on Chen et al., 2022). FORMATTING GOAL: Match attached slide style exactly." -o slides/03_methods.png --attach slides/02_intro.png
   
   # Combine to PDF
   python scripts/slides_to_pdf.py slides/*.png -o presentation.pdf
   ```

3. **Review & Iterate** (30 minutes):
   - Open the PDF and review each slide
   - Regenerate any slides that need improvement
   - Re-combine to PDF

4. **Practice** (2-3 hours):
   - Practice 3-5 times with timer
   - Aim for 13-14 minutes (leave buffer)
   - Record yourself, watch playback
   - **Prepare for questions** (use research-lookup to anticipate)

5. **Finalize** (30 minutes):
   - Generate backup/appendix slides if needed
   - Save multiple copies
   - Test on presentation computer

Total time: ~5-6 hours for quality AI-generated presentation

### Alternative: PowerPoint Workflow

If you need editable slides (e.g., for company templates):

1. **Plan slides** as above
2. **Generate visuals** with `--visual-only` flag:
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_slide_image.py "diagram description" -o figures/fig1.png --visual-only
   ```
3. **Build PPTX** using the PPTX skill with generated images
4. **Add text** separately using PPTX workflow

See `document-skills/pptx/SKILL.md` for complete PowerPoint workflow.

## Summary: Key Principles

1. **Visual-First Design**: Every slide needs strong visual element (figure, image, diagram) - avoid text-only slides
2. **Research-Backed**: Use research-lookup to find 8-15 papers, cite 3-5 in intro, 3-5 in discussion
3. **Modern Aesthetics**: Choose contemporary color palette matching topic, not default themes
4. **Minimal Text**: 3-4 bullets, 4-6 words each (24-28pt font), let visuals tell story
5. **Structure**: Follow story arc, spend 40-50% on results
6. **High Contrast**: 7:1 preferred for professional appearance
7. **Varied Layouts**: Mix full-figure, two-column, visual overlays (not all bullets)
8. **Timing**: Practice 3-5 times, ~1 slide per minute, never skip conclusions
9. **Validation**: Visual review workflow to catch overflow and overlap
10. **White Space**: 40-50% of slide empty for visual breathing room

**Remember**: 
- **Boring = Forgotten**: Dry, text-heavy slides fail to communicate your science
- **Visual + Research = Impact**: Combine compelling visuals with research-backed context
- **You are the presentation, slides are visual support**: They should enhance, not replace your talk

# Data Visualization for Slides

## Overview

Effective data visualization in presentations differs fundamentally from journal figures. While publications prioritize comprehensive detail, presentation slides must emphasize clarity, impact, and immediate comprehension. This guide covers adapting figures for slides, choosing appropriate chart types, and avoiding common visualization mistakes.

## Key Principles for Presentation Figures

### 1. Simplify, Don't Replicate

**The Core Difference**:
- **Journal figures**: Dense, detailed, for careful study
- **Presentation figures**: Clear, simplified, for quick understanding

**Simplification Strategies**:

**Remove Non-Essential Elements**:
- ❌ Minor gridlines
- ❌ Detailed legends (label directly instead)
- ❌ Multiple panels (split into separate slides)
- ❌ Secondary axes (rarely work in presentations)
- ❌ Dense tick marks and minor labels

**Focus on Key Message**:
- Show only the data supporting your current point
- Subset data if full dataset is overwhelming
- Highlight the specific comparison you're discussing
- Remove context that isn't immediately relevant

**Example Transformation**:
```
Journal Figure:
- 6 panels (A-F)
- 4 experimental conditions per panel
- 50+ data points visible
- Complex statistical annotations
- Small font labels

Presentation Version:
- 3 separate slides (1-2 panels each)
- Focus on key comparison per slide
- Large, clear data representation
- One statistical result highlighted
- Large, readable labels
```

### 2. Emphasize Visual Hierarchy

**Guide Attention**:
- Make key result visually dominant
- De-emphasize background or comparison data
- Use size, color, and position strategically

**Techniques**:

**Color Emphasis**:
```
Main Result: Bold, saturated color (e.g., blue)
Comparison: Muted gray or desaturated color
Background: Very light gray or white
```

**Size Emphasis**:
```
Key line/bar: Thicker (3-4pt)
Reference lines: Thinner (1-2pt)
Grid lines: Very thin (0.5pt) or remove
```

**Annotation**:
```
Add text callouts: "34% increase" with arrow
Add shapes: Circle key region
Add color highlights: Background shading for important area
```

### 3. Maximize Readability

**Font Sizes for Presentations**:
- **Axis labels**: 18-24pt minimum
- **Tick labels**: 16-20pt minimum
- **Title**: 24-32pt
- **Legend**: 16-20pt (or label directly on plot)
- **Annotations**: 18-24pt

**The Distance Test**:
- If your figure isn't readable at 2-3 feet from your laptop screen, it won't work in a presentation
- Test by stepping back from screen
- Better to split into multiple simpler figures

**Line and Marker Sizes**:
- **Lines**: 2-4pt thickness (thicker than journal figures)
- **Markers**: 8-12pt size
- **Error bars**: 1.5-2pt thickness
- **Bars**: Adequate width with clear spacing

### 4. Use Progressive Disclosure

**Build Complex Figures Incrementally**:

Instead of showing complete figure at once:
1. **Baseline**: Show axes and basic setup
2. **Data Group 1**: Add first dataset
3. **Data Group 2**: Add comparison dataset
4. **Highlight**: Emphasize key difference
5. **Interpretation**: Add annotation with finding

**Benefits**:
- Controls audience attention
- Prevents information overload
- Guides interpretation
- Emphasizes narrative structure

**Implementation**:
- PowerPoint: Use animation to reveal layers
- Beamer: Use `\pause` or overlays
- Static: Create sequence of slides building the figure

## Chart Types and When to Use Them

### Bar Charts

**Best For**:
- Comparing discrete categories
- Showing counts or frequencies
- Highlighting differences between groups

**Presentation Optimization**:
```
✅ DO:
- Large, clear bars with adequate spacing
- Horizontal bars for long category names
- Direct labeling on bars (not legend)
- Order by value (highest to lowest) unless natural order exists
- Start y-axis at zero for accurate visual comparison

❌ DON'T:
- Too many categories (max 8-10)
- 3D bars (distorts perception)
- Multiple grouped comparisons (split to separate slides)
- Decorative patterns or gradients
```

**Example Enhancement**:
```
Before: 12 categories, small fonts, legend
After: Top 6 categories only, large fonts, direct labels, key bar highlighted
```

### Line Graphs

**Best For**:
- Trends over time
- Continuous data relationships
- Comparing trajectories

**Presentation Optimization**:
```
✅ DO:
- Thick lines (2-4pt)
- Distinct colors AND line styles (solid, dashed, dotted)
- Direct line labeling (at end of lines, not legend)
- Highlight key line with color/thickness
- Minimal gridlines or none
- Clear markers at data points

❌ DON'T:
- More than 4-5 lines per plot
- Similar colors (ensure high contrast)
- Small markers or thin lines
- Cluttered with excess gridlines
```

**Time Series Tips**:
- Mark key events or interventions with vertical lines
- Annotate important time points
- Use shaded regions for different phases

### Scatter Plots

**Best For**:
- Relationships between two variables
- Correlations
- Distributions
- Outliers

**Presentation Optimization**:
```
✅ DO:
- Large, distinct markers (8-12pt)
- Color code groups clearly
- Show trendline if discussing correlation
- Annotate key points (outliers, examples)
- Report R² or p-value directly on plot

❌ DON'T:
- Overplot (too many overlapping points)
- Small markers
- Multiple marker types that look similar
- Missing scale information
```

**Overplotting Solutions**:
- Transparency (alpha) for overlapping points
- Hexbin or density plots for very large datasets
- Random jitter for discrete data
- Marginal distributions on axes

### Box Plots / Violin Plots

**Best For**:
- Distribution comparisons
- Showing variability and outliers
- Multiple group comparisons

**Presentation Optimization**:
```
✅ DO:
- Large, clear boxes
- Color code groups
- Add individual data points if n is small (< 30)
- Annotate median or mean values
- Explain components (quartiles, whiskers) first time shown

❌ DON'T:
- Assume audience knows box plot conventions
- Use without brief explanation
- Too many groups (max 6-8)
- Omit axis labels and units
```

**First Use**:
If your audience may be unfamiliar, briefly explain: "Box shows middle 50% of data, line is median, whiskers show range"

### Heatmaps

**Best For**:
- Matrix data
- Gene expression or correlation patterns
- Large datasets with patterns

**Presentation Optimization**:
```
✅ DO:
- Large cells (readable grid)
- Clear, intuitive color scale (diverging or sequential)
- Label rows and columns with large fonts
- Show color scale legend prominently
- Cluster or order meaningfully
- Highlight key region with border

❌ DON'T:
- Too many rows/columns (200×200 matrix unreadable)
- Poor color scales (rainbow, red-green)
- Missing dendrograms if claiming clusters
- Tiny labels
```

**Simplification**:
- Show subset of most interesting rows/columns
- Zoom to relevant region
- Split large heatmap across multiple slides

### Network Diagrams

**Best For**:
- Relationships and connections
- Pathways and networks
- Hierarchical structures

**Presentation Optimization**:
```
✅ DO:
- Large nodes and labels
- Clear edge directionality (arrows)
- Color or size code importance
- Highlight path of interest
- Simplify to essential connections
- Use layout that minimizes crossing edges

❌ DON'T:
- Show entire complex network at once
- Hairball diagrams (too many connections)
- Small labels on nodes
- Unclear what nodes and edges represent
```

**Build Strategy**:
1. Show simplified structure
2. Add key nodes progressively
3. Highlight path or subnetwork of interest
4. Annotate with functional interpretation

### Statistical Plots

**Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves**:
```
✅ Optimize:
- Thick lines (3-4pt)
- Show confidence intervals as shaded regions
- Mark censored observations clearly
- Report hazard ratio and p-value on plot
- Extend axes to show full follow-up
```

**Forest Plots**:
```
✅ Optimize:
- Large markers (diamonds or squares)
- Clear confidence interval bars
- Large font for study names
- Highlight overall estimate
- Show line of no effect prominently
```

**ROC Curves**:
```
✅ Optimize:
- Thick curve line
- Show diagonal reference line (AUC = 0.5)
- Report AUC with confidence interval on plot
- Mark optimal threshold if discussing cutpoint
- Compare ≤ 3 curves per plot
```

## Color in Data Visualizations

### Sequential Color Scales

**When to Use**: Ordered data (low to high)

**Good Palettes**:
- Blues: Light blue → Dark blue
- Greens: Light green → Dark green  
- Grays: Light gray → Black
- Viridis: Yellow → Purple (perceptually uniform)

**Avoid**:
- Rainbow scales (non-uniform perception)
- Red-green scales (color blindness)

### Diverging Color Scales

**When to Use**: Data with meaningful midpoint (e.g., +/− change, correlation from -1 to +1)

**Good Palettes**:
- Blue → White → Red
- Purple → White → Orange
- Blue → Gray → Orange

**Key Principle**: Midpoint should be visually neutral (white or light gray)

### Categorical Colors

**When to Use**: Distinct groups with no order

**Good Practices**:
- Maximum 5-7 colors for clarity
- High contrast between adjacent categories
- Color-blind safe combinations
- Consistent color mapping across slides

**Example Set**:
```
Blue (#0173B2)
Orange (#DE8F05)
Green (#029E73)
Purple (#CC78BC)
Red (#CA3542)
```

### Highlight Colors

**Strategy**: Use color to direct attention

```
Main Result: Bright, saturated color (e.g., blue)
Comparison: Neutral (gray) or muted color
Background: Very light gray or white
```

**Example Application**:
- Bar chart: Key bar in blue, others in light gray
- Line plot: Main line in bold blue, reference lines in thin gray
- Scatter: Group of interest in color, others faded

## Common Visualization Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Overwhelming Complexity

**Problem**: Showing too much data at once

**Example**:
- Figure with 12 panels
- Each panel has 6 experimental conditions
- Tiny fonts and dense layout
- Audience has 10 seconds to process

**Solution**:
- Split into 3-4 slides
- One comparison per slide
- Focus on key result
- Build understanding progressively

### Mistake 2: Illegible Labels

**Problem**: Text too small to read

**Common Issues**:
- 8-10pt axis labels (need ≥18pt)
- Tiny legend text
- Subscripts and superscripts disappear
- Fine-print p-values

**Solution**:
- Recreate figures for presentation (don't use journal versions directly)
- Test readability from distance
- Remove or enlarge small text
- Put detailed statistics in notes

### Mistake 3: Chart Junk

**Problem**: Unnecessary decorative elements

**Examples**:
- 3D effects on 2D data
- Excessive gridlines
- Distracting backgrounds
- Decorative borders or shadows
- Animation for decoration only

**Solution**:
- Remove all non-data ink
- Maximize data-ink ratio
- Clean, minimal design
- Let data be the focus

### Mistake 4: Misleading Scales

**Problem**: Visual representation distorts data

**Examples**:
- Bar charts not starting at zero
- Truncated y-axes exaggerating differences
- Inconsistent scales between panels
- Log scales without clear labeling

**Solution**:
- Bar charts: Always start at zero
- Line charts: Can truncate, but make clear
- Label log scales explicitly
- Maintain consistent scales for comparisons

### Mistake 5: Poor Color Choices

**Problem**: Colors reduce clarity or accessibility

**Examples**:
- Red-green for color-blind audience
- Low contrast (yellow on white)
- Too many colors
- Inconsistent color meaning

**Solution**:
- Use color-blind safe palettes
- Test contrast (minimum 4.5:1)
- Limit to 5-7 colors maximum
- Consistent meaning across slides

### Mistake 6: Missing Context

**Problem**: Audience can't interpret visualization

**Missing Elements**:
- Axis labels or units
- Sample sizes (n)
- Error bar meaning (SEM vs SD vs CI)
- Statistical significance indicators
- Scale or reference points

**Solution**:
- Label everything clearly
- Define abbreviations
- Report key statistics on plot
- Provide reference for comparison

### Mistake 7: Inefficient Chart Type

**Problem**: Wrong visualization for data type

**Examples**:
- Pie chart for >5 categories (use bar chart)
- 3D pie chart (especially bad)
- Dual y-axes (confusing)
- Line plot for discrete categories (use bar chart)

**Solution**:
- Match chart type to data type
- Consider what comparison you're showing
- Choose format that makes pattern obvious
- Test if message is immediately clear

## Progressive Disclosure Techniques

### Building a Complex Figure

**Scenario**: Showing multi-panel experimental result

**Approach 1: Sequential Panels**
```
Slide 1: Panel A only (baseline condition)
Slide 2: Panels A+B (add treatment effect)
Slide 3: Panels A+B+C (add time course)
Slide 4: All panels with interpretation overlay
```

**Approach 2: Layered Data**
```
Slide 1: Axes and experimental design schematic
Slide 2: Add control group data
Slide 3: Add treatment group data
Slide 4: Highlight difference, show statistics
```

**Approach 3: Zoom and Context**
```
Slide 1: Full dataset overview
Slide 2: Zoom to interesting region
Slide 3: Highlight specific points in zoomed view
```

### Animation vs. Multiple Slides

**Use Animation** (PowerPoint/Beamer overlays):
- Building bullet points
- Adding layers to same plot
- Highlighting different regions sequentially
- Smooth transitions within a concept

**Use Separate Slides**:
- Different data or experiments
- Major conceptual shifts
- Want to return to previous view
- Need to control timing flexibly

## Figure Preparation Workflow

### Step 1: Start with High-Quality Source

**For Generated Figures**:
- Export at high resolution (300 DPI minimum)
- Vector formats preferred (PDF, SVG)
- Large size (can scale down, not up)
- Clean, professional appearance

**For Published Figures**:
- Request high-resolution versions from authors/publishers
- Recreate if source not available
- Check reuse permissions

### Step 2: Simplify for Presentation

**Edit in Graphics Software**:
- Remove non-essential panels
- Enlarge fonts and labels
- Increase line widths and marker sizes
- Remove or simplify legends
- Add direct labels
- Remove excess gridlines

**Tools**:
- Adobe Illustrator (vector editing)
- Inkscape (free vector editing)
- PowerPoint/Keynote (basic editing)
- Python/R (programmatic recreation)

### Step 3: Optimize for Projection

**Check**:
- ✅ Readable from 10 feet away
- ✅ High contrast between elements
- ✅ Large enough to fill significant slide area
- ✅ Maintains quality when projected
- ✅ Works in various lighting conditions

**Test**:
- View on different screens
- Project if possible before talk
- Print at small scale (simulates distance)
- Check in grayscale (color-blind simulation)

### Step 4: Add Context and Annotations

**Enhancements**:
- Arrows pointing to key features
- Text boxes with key findings ("p < 0.001")
- Circles or rectangles highlighting regions
- Color coding matched to verbal description
- Reference lines or benchmarks

**Verbal Integration**:
- Plan what you'll say about each element
- Use "Notice that..." or "Here you can see..."
- Point to specific features during talk
- Explain axes and scales first time shown

## Recreating Journal Figures for Presentations

### When to Recreate

**Recreate When**:
- Original has small fonts
- Too many panels for one slide
- Multiple comparisons to parse
- Colors not accessible
- Data available to you

**Reuse When**:
- Already simple and clear
- Appropriate font sizes
- Single focused message
- High resolution available
- Remaking not feasible

### Recreation Tools

**Python (matplotlib, seaborn)**:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set presentation-friendly defaults
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 18
plt.rcParams['axes.linewidth'] = 2
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 3
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 6)

# Create plot with large, clear elements
# Export as high-res PNG or PDF
```

**R (ggplot2)**:
```r
library(ggplot2)

# Presentation theme
theme_presentation <- theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 18),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 16)
  )

# Apply to plots
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(size=4) + theme_presentation
```

**GraphPad Prism**:
- Increase font sizes in Format Axes
- Thicken lines in Format Graph
- Enlarge symbols
- Export as high-resolution image

**Excel/PowerPoint**:
- Select chart, Format → Text Options → Size (increase to 18-24pt)

# Presentation Structure Guide

## Overview

Effective scientific presentations follow a clear narrative structure that guides the audience through your research story. This guide provides structure templates for different talk lengths and contexts, helping you organize content for maximum impact and clarity.

## Core Narrative Structure

All scientific presentations should follow a story arc that engages, informs, and persuades:

1. **Hook**: Grab attention immediately (30 seconds - 1 minute)
2. **Context**: Establish the research area and importance (5-10% of talk)
3. **Problem/Gap**: Identify what's unknown or problematic (5-10% of talk)
4. **Approach**: Explain your solution or method (15-25% of talk)
5. **Results**: Present key findings (40-50% of talk)
6. **Implications**: Discuss meaning and impact (15-20% of talk)
7. **Closure**: Memorable conclusion and call to action (1-2 minutes)

This arc mirrors the scientific method while maintaining narrative flow that keeps audiences engaged.

## Slide Count Guidelines

**General Rule**: Approximately 1 slide per minute, with adjustments based on content complexity.

| Talk Duration | Total Slides | Title/Intro | Methods | Results | Discussion | Conclusion |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| 5 minutes (lightning) | 5-7 | 1-2 | 0-1 | 2-3 | 1 | 1 |
| 10 minutes (short) | 10-12 | 2 | 1-2 | 4-5 | 2-3 | 1 |
| 15 minutes (conference) | 15-18 | 2-3 | 2-3 | 6-8 | 3-4 | 1-2 |
| 20 minutes (extended) | 20-24 | 3 | 3-4 | 8-10 | 4-5 | 2 |
| 30 minutes (seminar) | 25-30 | 3-4 | 5-6 | 10-12 | 6-8 | 2 |
| 45 minutes (keynote) | 35-45 | 4-5 | 8-10 | 15-20 | 8-10 | 2-3 |
| 60 minutes (lecture) | 45-60 | 5-6 | 10-12 | 20-25 | 10-12 | 3-4 |

**Adjustments**:
- **Complex data**: Reduce slide count (spend more time per slide)
- **Simple concepts**: Can increase slide count slightly
- **Heavy animations**: Count as multiple slides if building incrementally
- **Q&A included**: Reduce content slides by 20-30%

## Opening Strategies

### The Hook (First 30-60 seconds)

Your opening sets the tone and captures attention. Effective hooks:

**1. Surprising Statistic**
- "Every year, X million people experience Y, yet only Z% receive effective treatment."
- Works well for applied research with societal impact

**2. Provocative Question**
- "What if I told you that everything we thought about X is wrong?"
- Engages audience immediately, creates curiosity

**3. Personal Story**
- "Five years ago, I encountered a patient/problem that changed how I think about..."
- Humanizes research, creates emotional connection

**4. Visual Puzzle**
- Start with an intriguing image or data visualization
- "Look at this pattern. What could explain it?"

**5. Contrasting Paradigms**
- "The traditional view says X, but new evidence suggests Y."
- Sets up tension and your contribution

**6. Scope and Scale**
- "This problem affects X people, costs Y dollars, and has been unsolved for Z years."
- Establishes immediate importance

### Title Slide Essentials

Your title slide should include:
- **Clear, specific title** (not generic)
- **Your name and credentials**
- **Affiliation(s) with logos**
- **Date and venue** (conference name)
- **Optional**: QR code to paper, slides, or resources
- **Optional**: Compelling background image related to research

**Title Crafting**:
- Be specific: "Machine Learning Predicts Alzheimer's Risk from Retinal Images" 
- Not vague: "Applications of AI in Healthcare"
- Include key method and outcome
- Maximum 15 words
- Avoid jargon if presenting to broader audience

### Outline Slides

For talks >20 minutes, include a brief outline slide:
- Shows 3-5 main sections
- Provides roadmap for audience
- Can return to outline as section dividers
- Keep simple and visual (not just bullet list)

Example outline approach:
```
[Icon] Background → [Icon] Methods → [Icon] Results → [Icon] Implications
```

## Closing Strategies

### Effective Conclusions

The last 1-2 minutes are most remembered. Strong conclusions:

**1. Key Takeaways Format**
- 3-5 bullet points summarizing main messages
- Each should be a complete, memorable sentence
- Not just "Results": make claims

**2. Call-Back Hook**
- Reference your opening hook or question
- "Remember that surprising statistic? Our findings suggest..."
- Creates narrative closure

**3. Practical Implications**
- "What does this mean for clinicians/researchers/policy?"
- Action-oriented takeaways
- Bridges science to application

**4. Visual Summary**
- Single powerful figure integrating all findings
- Conceptual model showing relationships
- Before/after comparison

**5. Future Outlook**
- "These findings open doors to..."
- 1-2 specific next steps
- Inspiration for audience's own work

### Acknowledgments Slide

Essential elements:
- **Funding sources** (with grant numbers)
- **Key collaborators** (with photos if space)
- **Institution/lab** (with logo)
- **Study participants** (appropriate mention)
- Keep brief (15-30 seconds max)
- Optional: Include contact info and QR codes here

### Final Slide

Your final slide stays visible during Q&A. Include:
- **"Thank you" or "Questions?"**
- **Your contact information** (email, Twitter/X)
- **QR code to paper, preprint, or slides**
- **Lab website or GitHub**
- **Key visual from your research** (not just text)

Avoid ending with "References" or dense acknowledgments—these don't facilitate discussion.

## Transition Techniques

Smooth transitions maintain narrative flow and audience orientation.

### Between Major Sections

**Explicit Transition Slides**:
- Use consistent visual style (color, icon, position)
- Single word or short phrase: "Methods" "Results" "Implications"
- Optional: Return to outline with current section highlighted

**Verbal Transitions**:
- "Now that we've established X, let's examine how we studied Y..."
- "With that background, I'll turn to our key findings..."
- "This raises the question: How did we measure this?"

### Between Related Slides

**Visual Continuity**:
- Repeat key element (figure, title format) across slides
- Use consistent color coding
- Progressive builds of same figure

**Verbal Bridges**:
- "Building on this finding..."
- "To test this further..."
- "This pattern was consistent across..."

### Signposting Language

Help audience track progress through talk:
- "First, I'll show... Second... Finally..."
- "There are three key findings to discuss..."
- "Now, let's turn to the most surprising result..."
- "Coming back to our original question..."

## Pacing and Timing

### Time Budgeting

**Plan timing for each slide**:
- Simple title/transition slides: 15-30 seconds
- Text content slides: 45-90 seconds
- Complex figures: 2-3 minutes
- Key results: 2-4 minutes each

**Common Timing Mistakes**:
- ❌ Spending too long on introduction (>15% of talk)
- ❌ Rushing through results (should be 40-50%)
- ❌ Not leaving time for questions
- ❌ Going over time (extremely unprofessional)

### Practice Strategies

**Full Run-Throughs** (Do 3-5 times):
1. **First run**: Rough timing, identify problem areas
2. **Second run**: Practice transitions, smooth language
3. **Third run**: Final timing with backup plans
4. **Recording**: Video yourself, watch for tics/filler words
5. **Audience practice**: Present to colleagues for feedback

**Section Practice**:
- Practice complex result slides multiple times
- Rehearse opening and closing until flawless
- Prepare ad-libs for common questions

**Timing Techniques**:
- Note target time at bottom of key slides
- Set phone/watch to vibrate at checkpoints
- Have Plan B: know which slides to skip if running over
- Practice with live timer visible

### Managing Time During Talk

**If Running Ahead** (rarely a problem):
- Expand on key points naturally
- Take questions mid-talk if appropriate
- Provide more context or examples
- Slow down slightly (but don't add filler)

**If Running Behind**:
- Skip backup slides or extra examples (prepare these in advance)
- Summarize rather than detail on secondary points
- Never rush through conclusions—skip earlier content instead
- NEVER say "I'll go quickly through these" (just skip them)

**Time Checkpoints**:
- 25% through talk = 25% through time
- 50% through talk = 50% through time
- After results = should have 5-10 minutes left
- Start conclusions with 2-3 minutes remaining

## Audience Engagement

### Reading the Room

**Visual Cues**:
- **Engaged**: Leaning forward, nodding, taking notes
- **Lost**: Confused expressions, checking phones
- **Bored**: Leaning back, glazed eyes, fidgeting

**Adjustments**:
- If losing audience: Speed up, add humor, show compelling visual
- If audience confused: Slow down, ask "Does this make sense?", re-explain
- If highly engaged: Can add more detail, encourage questions

### Interactive Elements

For seminars and longer talks:

**Rhetorical Questions**:
- "Why do you think this pattern occurred?"
- "What would you predict happens next?"
- Pauses for thought (don't immediately answer)

**Quick Polls** (if appropriate):
- "Raise your hand if you've encountered X..."
- "How many think the result will be A vs. B?"
- Brief, not disruptive

**Checkpoint Questions**:
- "Before I continue, are there questions about the methods?"
- "Is everyone comfortable with this concept?"
- For longer talks or tutorials

### Body Language and Delivery

**Effective Practices**:
- ✅ Stand to side of screen, facing audience
- ✅ Use pointer deliberately for specific elements
- ✅ Make eye contact with different sections of room
- ✅ Gesture naturally to emphasize points
- ✅ Vary voice pitch and pace
- ✅ Pause after important points

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Reading slides verbatim
- ❌ Turning back to audience
- ❌ Standing in front of projection
- ❌ Fidgeting with pointer/objects
- ❌ Pacing repetitively
- ❌ Monotone delivery

## Special Considerations

### Virtual Presentations

**Technical Setup**:
- Test screen sharing, audio, and video beforehand
- Use presenter mode if available (see notes)
- Ensure good lighting and camera angle
- Minimize background distractions

**Engagement Challenges**:
- Can't read audience body language as well
- More explicit engagement needed
- Use polls, chat, reactions if platform allows
- Encourage unmuting for questions

**Pacing**:
- Slightly slower pace (harder to interrupt virtually)
- More explicit transitions and signposting
- Build in planned pauses for questions
- Monitor chat for questions during talk

### Handling Questions

**During Talk**:
- For short talks: "Please hold questions until the end"
- For seminars: "Feel free to interrupt with questions"
- If interrupted: "Great question, let me finish this point and come back to it"

**Q&A Session**:
- **Listen fully** before answering
- **Repeat or rephrase** question for whole audience
- **Answer concisely** (30-90 seconds max)
- **Be honest** if you don't know: "That's a great question I don't have data on yet"
- **Redirect if off-topic**: "That's interesting but beyond scope. Happy to discuss after."
- **Have backup slides** with extra data/analyses ready

**Difficult Questions**:
- **Hostile**: Stay calm, acknowledge concern, stick to data
- **Confusing**: Ask for clarification: "Could you rephrase that?"
- **Out of scope**: "I focused on X, but your question about Y is important for future work"

### Technical Difficulties

**Preparation**:
- Have backup: PDF on laptop, cloud, and USB drive
- Test connections and adapters beforehand
- Know how to reset display if needed
- Have printout of slides as absolute backup

**During Talk**:
- Stay calm and professional
- Fill time with verbal explanation while fixing
- Skip problem slide if necessary
- Apologize briefly but don't dwell on it

## Reference: Slide_Design_Principles

# Slide Design Principles for Scientific Presentations

## Overview

Effective slide design enhances comprehension, maintains audience attention, and ensures your scientific message is communicated clearly. This guide covers visual hierarchy, typography, color theory, layout principles, and accessibility considerations for creating professional scientific presentations.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity and Clarity

**The Fundamental Rule**: Each slide should communicate ONE main idea.

**Why It Matters**:
- Audiences can only process limited information at once
- Complexity causes cognitive overload
- Simple slides are remembered; busy slides are forgotten

**Application**:
- ✅ One message per slide
- ✅ Minimal text (audiences read OR listen, not both simultaneously)
- ✅ Clear visual focus
- ✅ Generous white space
- ❌ Avoid cramming multiple concepts onto one slide

**Example Comparison**:
```
BAD: Single slide with:
- 3 different graphs
- 8 bullet points
- 2 tables
- Dense caption text

GOOD: Three separate slides:
- Slide 1: First graph with 2-3 key points
- Slide 2: Second graph with interpretation
- Slide 3: Summary table with highlighted finding
```

### 2. Visual Hierarchy

Guide attention to the most important elements through size, color, and position.

**Hierarchy Levels**:
1. **Primary**: Main message or key data (largest, highest contrast)
2. **Secondary**: Supporting information (medium size)
3. **Tertiary**: Details and labels (smaller, lower contrast)

**Techniques**:

**Size**:
- Title: Largest (36-54pt)
- Key findings: Large (24-32pt)
- Supporting text: Medium (18-24pt)
- Labels and notes: Smallest but legible (14-18pt)

**Color**:
- High contrast for key elements
- Accent colors for emphasis
- Muted colors for background or secondary info

**Position**:
- Top-left or top-center: Primary content (Western reading pattern)
- Center: Focal point for key visuals
- Bottom or sides: Supporting details

**Weight**:
- Bold for emphasis on key terms
- Regular weight for body text
- Light weight for de-emphasized content

### 3. Consistency

Maintain visual consistency throughout the presentation.

**Elements to Keep Consistent**:
- **Fonts**: Same font family for all slides
- **Colors**: Defined color palette (3-5 colors)
- **Layouts**: Similar slides use same structure
- **Spacing**: Margins and padding uniform
- **Style**: Figure formats, bullet styles, numbering

**Benefits**:
- Professional appearance
- Reduced cognitive load (audiences learn your visual language)
- Focus on content, not adjusting to new formats
- Easy to identify information types

**Template Approach**:
- Create master slide with standard elements
- Design 3-5 layout variants (title, content, figure, section divider)
- Apply consistently throughout

## Typography

### Font Selection

**Recommended Font Types**:

**Sans-Serif Fonts** (Highly Recommended):
- **Arial**: Universal, highly legible
- **Helvetica**: Clean, professional
- **Calibri**: Modern default, works well
- **Gill Sans**: Elegant sans-serif
- **Futura**: Geometric, modern
- **Avenir**: Friendly, professional

**Serif Fonts** (Use Sparingly):
- Generally harder to read on screens
- Acceptable for titles in some contexts
- Avoid for body text in presentations

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Script or handwriting fonts (illegible from distance)
- ❌ Decorative fonts (distracting)
- ❌ Condensed fonts (hard to read)
- ❌ Multiple font families (>2 looks unprofessional)

### Font Sizes

**Minimum Readable Sizes**:
- **Title slide title**: 44-54pt
- **Section headers**: 36-44pt
- **Slide titles**: 32-40pt
- **Body text**: 24-28pt (absolute minimum 18pt)
- **Figure labels**: 18-24pt
- **Captions and citations**: 14-16pt (use sparingly)

**The Room Test**:
- Can text be read from the back of the room?
- Rule: Body text should be readable at 6× screen height distance
- When in doubt: go larger

**Size Relationships**:
```
Title: 40pt
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Subheading: 28pt
─────────────
Body text: 24pt
Regular content for audience

Caption: 16pt
```

### Text Formatting

**Best Practices**:

**Line Length**:
- Maximum 50-60 characters per line
- Break long sentences into multiple lines
- Use phrases, not full sentences when possible

**Line Spacing**:
- 1.2-1.5× line height for readability
- More spacing for dense content
- Consistent spacing throughout

**Alignment**:
- **Left-aligned**: Best for body text (natural reading)
- **Center-aligned**: Titles, short phrases, key messages
- **Right-aligned**: Rarely used (occasionally for design balance)
- **Justified**: Avoid (creates awkward spacing)

**Emphasis**:
- ✅ **Bold** for key terms (use sparingly)
- ✅ Color for emphasis (consistent meaning)
- ✅ Size increase for importance
- ❌ Avoid italics (hard to read from distance)
- ❌ Avoid underline (confused with hyperlinks)
- ❌ AVOID ALL CAPS FOR BODY TEXT (READS AS SHOUTING)

### The 6×6 Rule

**Guideline**: Maximum 6 bullets per slide, maximum 6 words per bullet.

**Rationale**:
- More text = audience reads instead of listens
- Bullet points are prompts, not sentences
- You provide the explanation verbally

**Better Approach**:
- 3-4 bullets optimal
- 4-8 words per bullet
- Use fragments, not complete sentences
- Consider replacing text with visuals

**Example Transformation**:
```
TOO MUCH TEXT:
• Our study examined the relationship between dietary interventions 
  and cardiovascular outcomes in 1,500 participants over 5 years
• We found that participants in the intervention group showed 
  significantly reduced risk compared to controls
• The effect size was larger than previous studies and persisted 
  at long-term follow-up

BETTER:
• 5-year dietary intervention study
• 27% reduced cardiovascular risk
• Largest effect to date
```

## Color Theory

### Color Palettes for Scientific Presentations

**Purpose-Driven Color Selection**:

**Professional/Academic** (Conservative):
- Navy blue (#1C3D5A), gray (#4A5568), white (#FFFFFF)
- Accent: Orange (#E67E22) or green (#27AE60)
- Use: Faculty seminars, grant presentations, institutional talks

**Modern/Engaging** (Energetic):
- Teal (#0A9396), coral (#EE6C4D), cream (#F4F1DE)
- Accent: Burgundy (#780000)
- Use: Conference talks, public engagement, TED-style talks

**High Contrast** (Maximum Legibility):
- Black text (#000000) on white (#FFFFFF)
- Dark blue (#003366) on white
- White on dark gray (#2D3748)
- Use: Large venues, virtual presentations, accessibility priority

**Data Visualization** (Color-blind Safe):
- Blue (#0173B2), orange (#DE8F05), green (#029E73), red (#CC78BC)
- Based on Wong/IBM palettes
- Use: Figures with categorical data, bar charts, line plots

### Color Psychology in Science

**Blue**:
- Associations: Trust, stability, professionalism, intelligence
- Use: Backgrounds, institutional presentations, technology topics
- Caution: Can feel cold; balance with warmer accents

**Green**:
- Associations: Growth, health, nature, sustainability
- Use: Biology, environmental science, health outcomes
- Caution: Avoid red-green combinations (color blindness)

**Red/Orange**:
- Associations: Energy, urgency, warning, importance
- Use: Highlighting critical findings, emphasis, calls to action
- Caution: Don't overuse; loses impact

**Purple**:
- Associations: Innovation, creativity, wisdom
- Use: Neuroscience, novel methods, creative research
- Caution: Can appear less serious in some contexts

**Gray**:
- Associations: Neutrality, professionalism, sophistication
- Use: Backgrounds, de-emphasized content, grounding
- Caution: Can feel dull if overused

### Color Contrast and Accessibility

**WCAG Standards** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines):
- **Level AA**: 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- **Level AAA**: 7:1 contrast ratio (preferred for presentations)

**High Contrast Combinations**:
- ✅ Black on white (21:1)
- ✅ Dark blue (#003366) on white (12.6:1)
- ✅ White on dark gray (#2D3748) (11.8:1)
- ✅ Dark text (#333333) on cream (#F4F1DE) (9.7:1)

**Low Contrast Combinations** (Avoid):
- ❌ Light gray on white
- ❌ Yellow on white
- ❌ Pastel colors on white backgrounds
- ❌ Red on black (difficult to read)

**Testing Contrast**:
- Use online tools (e.g., WebAIM Contrast Checker)
- Print slide in grayscale (should remain legible)
- View from distance (simulate audience perspective)

### Color Blindness Considerations

**Prevalence**: ~8% of men, ~0.5% of women have color vision deficiency

**Most Common**: Red-green color blindness (protanopia/deuteranopia)

**Safe Practices**:
- ✅ Use blue/orange instead of red/green
- ✅ Add patterns or shapes in addition to color
- ✅ Use color AND other differentiators (shape, size, position)
- ✅ Test with color blindness simulator

**Color-Blind Safe Palettes**:
```
Primary: Blue (#0173B2)
Contrast: Orange (#DE8F05)  [NOT green]
Additional: Magenta (#CC78BC), Teal (#029E73)
```

**Figure Design**:
- Don't rely solely on red vs. green lines
- Use different line styles (solid, dashed, dotted)
- Use symbols (circle, square, triangle) for scatter plots
- Label directly on plot rather than color legend only

## Layout and Composition

### The Rule of Thirds

Divide slide into 3×3 grid; place key elements at intersections or along lines.

**Application**:
```
+-------+-------+-------+
|   ┃   |   ┃   |   ┃   |
|---●---|---●---|---●---|  ← Key focal points (●)
|   ┃   |   ┃   |   ┃   |
|---●---|---●---|---●---|
|   ┃   |   ┃   |   ┃   |
|---●---|---●---|---●---|
|   ┃   |   ┃   |   ┃   |
+-------+-------+-------+
```

**Benefits**:
- More visually interesting than centered layouts
- Natural eye flow
- Professional appearance
- Guides attention strategically

**Example Usage**:
- Place key figure at right third
- Text summary on left two-thirds
- Title at top third line
- Logo at bottom-right intersection

### White Space

**Definition**: Empty space around and between elements.

**Purpose**:
- Gives content room to "breathe"
- Increases focus on important elements
- Prevents overwhelming the audience
- Projects professionalism and confidence

**Guidelines**:
- Margins: Minimum 5-10% of slide on all sides
- Element spacing: Clear separation between unrelated items
- Text padding: Space around text blocks
- Don't fill every pixel: Empty space is valuable

**Common Mistakes**:
- Cramming too much on one slide
- Extending content to edges
- No space between elements
- Fear of "wasting" space

### Layout Patterns

**Title + Content**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Slide Title             │
├─────────────────────────┤
│                         │
│    Content Area         │
│    (text, figure,       │
│     or combination)     │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```
Use: Standard slide type, most common

**Two Column**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Slide Title             │
├───────────┬─────────────┤
│           │             │
│  Text     │   Figure    │
│  Column   │   Column    │
│           │             │
└───────────┴─────────────┘
```
Use: Comparing items, text + figure

**Full-Slide Figure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                         │
│                         │
│    Large Figure or      │
│    Image                │
│                         │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```
Use: Key results, impactful visuals

**Text Overlay**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   ┌─────────────┐       │
│   │ Text Box    │       │
│   └─────────────┘       │
│     Background Image    │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```
Use: Title slide, section dividers

**Grid Layout**:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Title                   │
├─────────┬───────┬───────┤
│ Item 1  │ Item 2│ Item 3│
├─────────┼───────┼───────┤
│ Item 4  │ Item 5│ Item 6│
└─────────┴───────┴───────┘
```
Use: Multiple related items, comparisons

### Alignment

**Principle**: Align elements to create visual order and relationships.

**Types**:

**Edge Alignment**:
- Align left edges of text blocks
- Align right edges of figures
- Align top edges of items in row

**Center Alignment**:
- Center title on slide
- Center key messages
- Center lone figures

**Grid Alignment**:
- Use invisible grid
- Snap elements to grid lines
- Maintains consistency across slides

**Visual Impact**:
- Aligned elements look intentional and professional
- Misaligned elements appear careless
- Small misalignments are very noticeable

## Background Design

### Background Colors

**Best Practices**:

**Light Backgrounds** (Most Common):
- White or off-white (#FFFFFF, #F8F9FA)
- Very light gray (#F5F5F5)
- Cream/beige (#FAF8F3)

**Advantages**:
- Maximum contrast for dark text
- Works in any lighting
- Professional and clean
- Easier on projectors

**Dark Backgrounds**:
- Dark gray (#2D3748)
- Navy blue (#1A202C)
- Black (#000000)

**Advantages**:
- Modern, sophisticated
- Good for dark venues
- Reduces eye strain in dark rooms
- Makes colors pop

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires light-colored text
- Can be difficult in bright rooms
- Some projectors handle poorly

**Gradient Backgrounds**:
- ✅ Subtle gradients acceptable (light to lighter)
- ❌ Avoid busy or high-contrast gradients
- ❌ Don't distract from content

**Image Backgrounds**:
- Use only for title/section slides
- Ensure sufficient contrast with text
- Add semi-transparent overlay if needed
- Avoid busy or cluttered images

### Borders and Frames

**Minimal Approach** (Recommended):
- No borders on most slides
- Let white space define boundaries
- Clean, modern appearance

**Selective Borders**:
- Around key figures for emphasis
- Separating distinct sections
- Highlighting callout boxes
- Simple, thin lines only

**Avoid**:
- Decorative borders
- Thick, colorful frames
- Clipart-style elements
- 3D effects and shadows

## Visual Elements

### Icons and Graphics

**Purpose**:
- Visual anchors for concepts
- Break up text-heavy slides
- Quick recognition of section types
- Add visual interest

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Consistent style (all outline or all filled)
- ✅ Simple, recognizable designs
- ✅ Appropriate size (not too large or small)
- ✅ Limited color palette matching theme
- ❌ Avoid clipart or cartoonish graphics (unless appropriate)
- ❌ Don't use for decoration only (should convey meaning)

**Sources**:
- Font Awesome
- Noun Project
- Material Design Icons
- Custom scientific illustrations

### Bullets and Lists

**Bullet Styles**:
- **Simple shapes**: Circle (•), square (■), dash (−)
- **Avoid**: Complex symbols, changing bullet styles within list
- **Hierarchy**: Different bullets for different levels

**List Best Practices**:
- Maximum 4-6 items per list
- Parallel structure (all start with verb, or all nouns, etc.)
- Use fragments, not complete sentences
- Adequate spacing between items (1.5-2× line height)

**Alternative to Bullets**:
- **Numbered lists**: When order matters
- **Icons**: Visual representation of each point
- **Progressive builds**: Reveal one point at a time
- **Separate slides**: One concept per slide

### Shapes and Dividers

**Uses**:
- Background rectangles to highlight content
- Arrows showing relationships or flow
- Circles for emphasis or grouping
- Lines separating sections

**Guidelines**:
- Keep shapes simple (rectangles, circles, lines)
- Use brand colors
- Maintain consistency
- Avoid 3D effects
- Don't overuse

## Animation and Builds

### When to Use Animation

**Appropriate Uses**:
- **Progressive disclosure**: Reveal bullet points one at a time
- **Build complex figures**: Add layers incrementally
- **Show process**: Illustrate sequential steps
- **Emphasize transitions**: Highlight connections
- **Control pacing**: Prevent audience from reading ahead

**Inappropriate Uses**:
- ❌ Decoration or entertainment
- ❌ Every slide transition
- ❌ Multiple animations per slide
- ❌ Distracting effects (spin, bounce, etc.)

### Types of Animations

**Entrance**:
- **Appear**: Instant (good for fast-paced talks)
- **Fade**: Subtle, professional
- **Wipe**: Directional reveal
- Avoid: Fly in, bounce, spiral, etc.

**Exit**:
- Rarely needed
- Use to remove intermediary steps
- Keep simple (fade or disappear)

**Emphasis**:
- Color change for highlighting
- Bold/underline to draw attention
- Grow slightly for importance
- Use very sparingly

**Builds**:
- Reveal bullet points progressively
- Add elements to complex figure
- Show before/after states
- Demonstrate process steps

**Best Practices**:
- Fast transitions (0.2-0.3 seconds)
- Consistent animation type throughout
- Click to advance (not automatic timing)
- Builds should add clarity, not complexity

## Common Design Mistakes

### Content Mistakes

**Too Much Text**:
- Problem: Audience reads instead of listening
- Fix: Use key phrases, not paragraphs; move details to notes

**Too Many Concepts per Slide**:
- Problem: Cognitive overload, unclear focus
- Fix: One idea per slide; split complex slides into multiple

**Inconsistent Formatting**:
- Problem: Looks unprofessional, distracting
- Fix: Use templates, maintain style guide

**Poor Contrast**:
- Problem: Illegible from distance
- Fix: Test at actual presentation size, use high-contrast combinations

**Tiny Fonts**:
- Problem: Unreadable for audience
- Fix: Minimum 18pt, preferably 24pt+ for body text

### Visual Mistakes

**Cluttered Slides**:
- Problem: No clear focal point, overwhelming
- Fix: Embrace white space, remove non-essential elements

**Low-Quality Images**:
- Problem: Pixelated or blurry figures
- Fix: Use high-resolution images (300 DPI minimum)

**Distracting Backgrounds**:
- Problem: Competes with content
- Fix: Simple, solid colors or subtle gradients

**Overuse of Effects**:
- Problem: Looks amateurish, distracting
- Fix: Minimal or no shadows, gradients, 3D effects

**Misaligned Elements**:
- Problem: Appears careless
- Fix: Use alignment tools, grids, and guides

## Reference: Visual_Review_Workflow

# Visual Review Workflow for Presentations

## Overview

Visual review is a critical quality assurance step for presentations, allowing you to identify and fix layout issues, text overflow, element overlap, and design problems before presenting. This guide covers converting presentations to images, systematic visual inspection, common issues, and iterative improvement strategies.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: NEVER READ PDF PRESENTATIONS DIRECTLY

**MANDATORY: Always convert presentation PDFs to images FIRST, then review the images.**

### Why This Rule Exists

- **Buffer Overflow Prevention**: Presentation PDFs (especially multi-slide decks) cause "JSON message exceeded maximum buffer size" errors when read directly
- **Visual Accuracy**: Images show exactly what the audience will see, including rendering issues
- **Performance**: Image-based review is faster and more reliable than PDF text extraction
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform review process for all presentations

### The ONLY Correct Workflow for Presentations

1. ✅ Generate PDF from PowerPoint/Beamer source
2. ✅ **Convert PDF to images** using the pdf_to_images.py script
3. ✅ **Review the image files** systematically
4. ✅ Document issues by slide number
5. ✅ Fix issues in source files
6. ✅ Regenerate PDF and repeat

### What NOT To Do

- ❌ NEVER use read_file tool on presentation PDFs
- ❌ NEVER attempt to read PDF slides as text
- ❌ NEVER skip the image conversion step
- ❌ NEVER assume PDF is "small enough" to read directly

**If you're reviewing a presentation and haven't converted to images yet, STOP and convert first.**

## Why Visual Review Matters

### Common Problems Invisible in Source

**LaTeX Beamer Issues**:
- Text overflow from text boxes
- Overlapping elements (equations over images)
- Poor line breaking
- Figures extending beyond slide boundaries
- Font size issues at actual resolution

**PowerPoint Issues**:
- Text cut off by shapes or slide edges
- Images overlapping with text
- Inconsistent spacing between slides
- Color rendering differences
- Font substitution problems

**Projection Issues**:
- Content visible on laptop but cut off when projected
- Colors looking different on projector
- Low contrast elements becoming invisible
- Small details disappearing

### Benefits of Visual Review

- **Catch layout errors early**: Fix before printing or presenting
- **Verify readability**: Ensure text is large enough and high contrast
- **Check consistency**: Spot inconsistencies across slides
- **Test accessibility**: Verify color contrast and clarity
- **Validate design**: Ensure professional appearance

## Conversion: PDF to Images

### Method 1: Using pdf_to_images.py Script (Recommended)

**No External Dependencies Required**:
The script uses PyMuPDF, a self-contained Python library - no poppler or other system software needed.

**Installation**:
```bash
# PyMuPDF is included as a project dependency
pip install pymupdf
```

**Basic Conversion**:
```bash
# Convert all slides to JPEG images
python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf slide --dpi 150

# Creates: slide-001.jpg, slide-002.jpg, slide-003.jpg, ...
```

**High-Resolution Conversion**:
```bash
# Higher quality for detailed inspection (300 DPI)
python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf slide --dpi 300

# PNG format (lossless, larger files)
python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf slide --dpi 150 --format png
```

**Convert Specific Slides**:
```bash
# Slides 5-10 only
python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf slide --dpi 150 --first 5 --last 10

# Single slide
python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf slide --dpi 150 --first 3 --last 3
```

**Output Options**:
```bash
# Different output directory
python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf review/slide --dpi 150

# Custom naming
python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf output/presentation --dpi 150
```

### Method 2: Using PowerPoint Thumbnail Script

For PowerPoint presentations, use the pptx skill's thumbnail tool:

```bash
# Create thumbnail grid
python scripts/thumbnail.py presentation.pptx output --cols 4

# Individual slides
python scripts/thumbnail.py presentation.pptx slides/slide --individual
```

**Advantages**:
- Optimized for PowerPoint files
- Can create overview grids
- Handles .pptx format directly
- Customizable layout

### Method 3: Using ImageMagick

**Installation**:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install imagemagick

# macOS
brew install imagemagick
```

**Conversion**:
```bash
# Convert PDF to images
convert -density 150 presentation.pdf slide.jpg

# Higher quality
convert -density 300 presentation.pdf slide.jpg

# Specific format
convert -density 150 presentation.pdf slide.png
```

### Method 4: Using Python (Programmatic)

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

# Open PDF
doc = fitz.open('presentation.pdf')

# Convert each page to image
zoom = 200 / 72  # 200 DPI (72 is base DPI)
matrix = fitz.Matrix(zoom, zoom)

for i, page in enumerate(doc, start=1):
    pixmap = page.get_pixmap(matrix=matrix)
    pixmap.save(f'slide-{i:03d}.jpg', output='jpeg')

doc.close()
```

**Install PyMuPDF**:
```bash
pip install pymupdf
# No external dependencies needed!
```

## Systematic Visual Inspection

### Inspection Workflow

**Step 1: Overview Pass**
- View all slides quickly
- Note overall consistency
- Identify obviously problematic slides
- Create list of slides needing detailed review

**Step 2: Detailed Inspection**
- Review each flagged slide carefully
- Check against issue checklist (below)
- Document specific problems with slide numbers
- Take notes on required fixes

**Step 3: Cross-Slide Comparison**
- Check consistency across similar slides
- Verify uniform spacing and alignment
- Ensure consistent font sizes
- Check color scheme consistency

**Step 4: Distance Test**
- View images at reduced size (simulates projection)
- Check readability from ~6 feet
- Verify key elements are visible
- Test if main message is clear

```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Text Overflow

**Problem**: Text extends beyond boundaries

**Identification**:
- Visible text cut off at edge
- Text running into margins
- Partial characters visible

**Solutions**:

**LaTeX Beamer**:
```latex
% Reduce text
\begin{frame}{Title}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shorten this long bullet point
    % or
    \item Use abbreviations or acronyms
    % or
    \item<alert@1> Split into multiple bullets
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Adjust margins
\newgeometry{margin=1.5cm}
\begin{frame}
  Content with wider margins
\end{frame}
\restoregeometry

% Smaller font for specific element
{\small
  Long text that needs to fit
}
```

**PowerPoint**:
- Reduce font size for that element
- Shorten text content
- Increase text box size
- Use text box auto-fit options (cautiously)
- Split into multiple slides

### Issue 2: Element Overlap

**Problem**: Elements overlapping inappropriately

**Identification**:
- Text obscured by images
- Shapes covering text
- Figures overlapping

**Solutions**:

**LaTeX Beamer**:
```latex
% Use columns for better separation
\begin{columns}
  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    Text content
  \end{column}
  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure.pdf}
  \end{column}
\end{columns}

% Add spacing
\vspace{0.5cm}

% Adjust figure size
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure.pdf}
```

**PowerPoint**:
- Use alignment guides to reposition
- Reduce element sizes
- Use two-column layout
- Send elements backward/forward (layering)
- Increase spacing between elements

### Issue 3: Poor Contrast

**Problem**: Text difficult to read due to color choices

**Identification**:
- Squinting required to read text
- Text fades into background
- Colors too similar

**Solutions**:

**LaTeX Beamer**:
```latex
% Increase contrast
\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{fg=black,bg=white}
\setbeamercolor{normal text}{fg=black,bg=white}

% Use darker colors
\definecolor{darkblue}{RGB}{0,50,100}
\setbeamercolor{structure}{fg=darkblue}

% Test in grayscale
\usepackage{xcolor}
\selectcolormodel{gray}  % Temporarily for testing
```

**PowerPoint**:
- Choose high-contrast color combinations
- Use dark text on light background or vice versa
- Avoid pastels for text
- Test with WebAIM contrast checker
- Add text background box if needed

### Issue 4: Tiny Fonts

**Problem**: Text too small to read from distance

**Identification**:
- Can't read text from 3 feet away
- Axis labels disappear when viewing normally
- Captions illegible

**Solutions**:

**LaTeX Beamer**:
```latex
% Increase base font size
\documentclass[14pt]{beamer}  % Instead of 11pt default

% Recreate figures with larger fonts
% In matplotlib:
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 18
plt.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 20

% In R/ggplot2:
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 16))
```

**PowerPoint**:
- Minimum 18pt for body text, 24pt preferred
- Recreate figures with larger labels
- Use direct labeling instead of legends
- Simplify complex figures
- Split dense content across multiple slides

### Issue 5: Misalignment

**Problem**: Elements not properly aligned

**Identification**:
- Uneven margins
- Titles at different positions
- Irregular spacing

**Solutions**:

**LaTeX Beamer**:
```latex
% Use consistent templates
\setbeamertemplate{frametitle}[default][center]

% Align columns at top
\begin{columns}[T]  % T = top alignment
  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    Content
  \end{column}
  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    Content
  \end{column}
\end{columns}

% Center figures
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure.pdf}
\end{center}
```

**PowerPoint**:
- Use alignment tools (Align Left/Center/Right)
- Enable gridlines and guides
- Use snap to grid
- Distribute objects evenly
- Create master slides with consistent layouts

## Automated Detection Strategies

### Python Script for Text Overflow Detection

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def detect_edge_content(image_path, threshold=10):
    """
    Detect if content extends too close to slide edges.
    Returns True if potential overflow detected.
    """
    img = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')  # Grayscale
    arr = np.array(img)
    
    # Check edges (10 pixel border)
    left_edge = arr[:, :threshold]
    right_edge = arr[:, -threshold:]
    top_edge = arr[:threshold, :]
    bottom_edge = arr[-threshold:, :]
    
    # Look for non-white pixels (content)
    white_threshold = 240
    
    issues = []
    if np.any(left_edge < white_threshold):
        issues.append("Left edge")
    if np.any(right_edge < white_threshold):
        issues.append("Right edge")
    if np.any(top_edge < white_threshold):
        issues.append("Top edge")
    if np.any(bottom_edge < white_threshold):
        issues.append("Bottom edge")
    
    return issues

# Usage
for slide_num in range(1, 26):
    issues = detect_edge_content(f'slide-{slide_num}.jpg')
    if issues:
        print(f"Slide {slide_num}: Content near {', '.join(issues)}")
```

### Contrast Checking

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def check_contrast(image_path):
    """
    Estimate contrast ratio in image.
    Simple version: compare lightest and darkest regions.
    """
    img = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')
    arr = np.array(img)
    
    # Get brightness values
    bright = np.percentile(arr, 95)
    dark = np.percentile(arr, 5)
    
    # Rough contrast ratio
    contrast = (bright + 0.05) / (dark + 0.05)
    
    if contrast < 4.5:
        return f"Low contrast: {contrast:.1f}:1 (minimum 4.5:1)"
    return f"OK: {contrast:.1f}:1"

# Usage
for slide_num in range(1, 26):
    result = check_contrast(f'slide-{slide_num}.jpg')
    print(f"Slide {slide_num}: {result}")
```
