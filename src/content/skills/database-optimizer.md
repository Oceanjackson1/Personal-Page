# Database Optimizer

Senior database optimizer with expertise in performance tuning, query optimization, and scalability across multiple database systems.

## When to Use This Skill

- Analyzing slow queries and execution plans
- Designing optimal index strategies
- Tuning database configuration parameters
- Optimizing schema design and partitioning
- Reducing lock contention and deadlocks
- Improving cache hit rates and memory usage

## Core Workflow

1. **Analyze Performance** — Capture baseline metrics and run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before any changes
2. **Identify Bottlenecks** — Find inefficient queries, missing indexes, config issues
3. **Design Solutions** — Create index strategies, query rewrites, schema improvements
4. **Implement Changes** — Apply optimizations incrementally with monitoring; validate each change before proceeding to the next
5. **Validate Results** — Re-run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, compare costs, measure wall-clock improvement, document changes

> ⚠️ Always test changes in non-production first. Revert immediately if write performance degrades or replication lag increases.

## Common Operations & Examples

### Identify Top Slow Queries (PostgreSQL)
```sql
-- Requires pg_stat_statements extension
SELECT query,
       calls,
       round(total_exec_time::numeric, 2)  AS total_ms,
       round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2)   AS mean_ms,
       round(stddev_exec_time::numeric, 2) AS stddev_ms,
       rows
FROM   pg_stat_statements
ORDER  BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT  20;
```

### Capture an Execution Plan
```sql
-- Use BUFFERS to expose cache hit vs. disk read ratio
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT TEXT)
SELECT o.id, c.name
FROM   orders o
JOIN   customers c ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE  o.status = 'pending'
  AND  o.created_at > now() - interval '7 days';
```

### Reading EXPLAIN Output — Key Patterns to Find

| Pattern | Symptom | Typical Remedy |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `Seq Scan` on large table | High row estimate, no filter selectivity | Add B-tree index on filter column |
| `Nested Loop` with large outer set | Exponential row growth in inner loop | Consider Hash Join; index inner join key |
| `cost=... rows=1` but actual rows=50000 | Stale statistics | Run `ANALYZE <table>;` |
| `Buffers: hit=10 read=90000` | Low buffer cache hit rate | Increase `shared_buffers`; add covering index |
| `Sort Method: external merge` | Sort spilling to disk | Increase `work_mem` for the session |

### Create a Covering Index
```sql
-- Covers the filter AND the projected columns, eliminating a heap fetch
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_status_created_covering
    ON orders (status, created_at)
    INCLUDE (customer_id, total_amount);
```

### Validate Improvement
```sql
-- Before optimization: save plan & timing
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) <query>;   -- note "Execution Time: X ms"

-- After optimization: compare
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) <query>;   -- target meaningful reduction in cost & time

-- Confirm index is actually used
SELECT indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM   pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE  relname = 'orders';
```

### MySQL: Find Slow Queries
```sql
-- Inspect slow query log candidates
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER  BY SUM_TIMER_WAIT DESC
LIMIT  20;

-- Execution plan
EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;
```

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Capture `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` output **before** optimizing — this is the baseline
- Measure performance before and after every change
- Create indexes with `CONCURRENTLY` (PostgreSQL) to avoid table locks
- Test in non-production; roll back if write performance or replication lag worsens
- Document all optimization decisions with before/after metrics
- Run `ANALYZE` after bulk data changes to refresh statistics

### MUST NOT DO
- Apply optimizations without a measured baseline
- Create redundant or unused indexes
- Make multiple changes simultaneously (impossible to attribute impact)
- Ignore write amplification caused by new indexes
- Neglect `VACUUM` / statistics maintenance

## Output Templates

When optimizing database performance, provide:
1. Performance analysis with baseline metrics (query time, cost, buffer hit ratio)
2. Identified bottlenecks and root causes (with EXPLAIN evidence)
3. Optimization strategy with specific changes
4. Implementation SQL / config changes
5. Validation queries to measure improvement
6. Monitoring recommendations

## Reference: Index Strategies

# Index Strategies

## Index Selection Methodology

### Identify Index Candidates

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Find queries missing indexes
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_exec_time > 100
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- PostgreSQL: Find sequential scans on large tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, seq_scan, seq_tup_read,
       idx_scan, seq_tup_read / seq_scan as avg_seq_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan > 0
  AND seq_tup_read / seq_scan > 10000
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC;

-- MySQL: Check table scans
SELECT * FROM sys.statements_with_full_table_scans
WHERE db = 'your_database'
ORDER BY exec_count DESC;
```

## B-Tree Indexes (Default)

### Single Column Indexes

```sql
-- Create index for WHERE clauses
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Create index for JOIN conditions
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);

-- Create index for ORDER BY
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON products(price);

-- Unique constraint as index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
```

### Multi-Column Indexes

```sql
-- Order matters: most selective column first
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_created
ON orders(status, created_at);

-- Good for queries:
-- WHERE status = 'pending'
-- WHERE status = 'pending' AND created_at > '2024-01-01'
-- WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY created_at

-- NOT good for:
-- WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01' (status not specified)

-- Include commonly queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active_email_name
ON users(active, email) INCLUDE (name);
```

### Column Order Guidelines

```sql
-- Rule 1: Equality before range
CREATE INDEX idx_events_type_timestamp
ON events(type, timestamp);  -- type = 'click' AND timestamp > ...

-- Rule 2: High selectivity first
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_status
ON orders(user_id, status);  -- user_id is more selective than status

-- Rule 3: Match query patterns
-- Query: WHERE country = 'US' AND city = 'NYC' AND zip = '10001'
CREATE INDEX idx_locations_country_city_zip
ON locations(country, city, zip);
```

## Covering Indexes

### PostgreSQL INCLUDE Clause

```sql
-- Include non-key columns for index-only scans
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_covering
ON users(email) INCLUDE (name, created_at);

-- Query can be satisfied entirely from index
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT name, created_at
FROM users
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
-- Should show "Index Only Scan"
```

### MySQL Covering Indexes

```sql
-- MySQL: Add columns to end of index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_covering
ON orders(user_id, status, created_at, total);

-- Query uses covering index
EXPLAIN
SELECT status, created_at, total
FROM orders
WHERE user_id = 123;
-- Should show "Using index" in Extra column
```

## Partial Indexes

### PostgreSQL Partial Indexes

```sql
-- Index only active users
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active_email
ON users(email)
WHERE active = true;

-- Index only recent orders
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_recent
ON orders(user_id, created_at)
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Index only pending/processing orders (ignore completed)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_active
ON orders(status, user_id)
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');

-- Smaller index = better performance + less storage
```

### MySQL Filtered Indexes (8.0+)

```sql
-- MySQL 8.0+ supports functional indexes for similar effect
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active
ON users((CASE WHEN active = 1 THEN email END));
```

## Expression Indexes

### PostgreSQL Function Indexes

```sql
-- Index for case-insensitive search
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_lower
ON users(LOWER(email));

-- Query must match expression
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER('User@Example.com');

-- Index for JSONB queries
CREATE INDEX idx_users_settings_theme
ON users((settings->>'theme'));

SELECT * FROM users
WHERE settings->>'theme' = 'dark';

-- Index for date truncation
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date
ON orders(DATE(created_at));
```

### MySQL Generated Column Indexes

```sql
-- Create generated column, then index it
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN email_lower VARCHAR(255)
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (LOWER(email)) STORED;

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_lower
ON users(email_lower);

-- Use in queries
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE email_lower = LOWER('User@Example.com');
```

## Specialized Index Types

### PostgreSQL GIN Indexes (Full-Text, Arrays, JSONB)

```sql
-- Full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_search
ON posts USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content));

SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content)
      @@ to_tsquery('english', 'database & optimization');

-- Array search
CREATE INDEX idx_products_tags
ON products USING GIN(tags);

SELECT * FROM products
WHERE tags @> ARRAY['electronics', 'sale'];

-- JSONB search
CREATE INDEX idx_users_metadata
ON users USING GIN(metadata);

SELECT * FROM users
WHERE metadata @> '{"plan": "premium"}';
```

### PostgreSQL GiST Indexes (Geometric, Range)

```sql
-- Range types
CREATE INDEX idx_events_time_range
ON events USING GIST(time_range);

SELECT * FROM events
WHERE time_range && '[2024-01-01, 2024-01-31]'::tstzrange;

-- PostGIS geometric queries
CREATE INDEX idx_locations_coords
ON locations USING GIST(coordinates);
```

### MySQL Full-Text Indexes

```sql
-- Full-text search
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_posts_content
ON posts(title, content);

SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE MATCH(title, content)
      AGAINST('database optimization' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);

-- Boolean mode for complex searches
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE MATCH(title, content)
      AGAINST('+database -mysql' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

## Index Maintenance

### PostgreSQL Maintenance

```sql
-- Update statistics for query planner
ANALYZE users;

-- Rebuild bloated index
REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email;

-- Check index bloat
SELECT
    schemaname, tablename, indexname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as index_size,
    idx_scan as scans,
    idx_tup_read as tuples_read,
    idx_tup_fetch as tuples_fetched
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;

-- Find unused indexes
SELECT
    schemaname, tablename, indexname,
    idx_scan,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0
  AND indexrelname NOT LIKE 'pg_toast%'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;
```

### MySQL Maintenance

```sql
-- Update statistics
ANALYZE TABLE users;

-- Rebuild index
ALTER TABLE users DROP INDEX idx_users_email, ADD INDEX idx_users_email(email);

-- Check index usage
SELECT
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    index_name,
    count_star,
    count_read,
    count_fetch
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE object_schema = 'your_database'
ORDER BY count_star DESC;

-- Find unused indexes
SELECT
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    index_name
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE index_name IS NOT NULL
  AND count_star = 0
  AND object_schema = 'your_database';
```

## Index Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Issue | Solution |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Index every column | Write overhead, storage waste | Index based on query patterns |
| Redundant indexes | `(a)` + `(a,b)` | Keep only `(a,b)` |
| Wrong column order | `(created_at, user_id)` for `WHERE user_id = ?` | Put filtered columns first |
| Over-covering | Including rarely-used columns | Include only frequently accessed columns |
| Ignoring WHERE clause | Full index for 5% of data | Use partial indexes |
| Expression mismatch | Index `email`, query `LOWER(email)` | Create expression index |

## Index Design Checklist

1. **Analyze queries**: Use pg_stat_statements or slow query log
2. **Check execution plans**: Look for Seq Scan on large tables
3. **Design indexes**: Equality → Range → Include
4. **Create concurrently**: Avoid locking (PostgreSQL)
5. **Validate improvement**: Compare before/after EXPLAIN
6. **Monitor usage**: Remove unused indexes after 30 days
7. **Maintain regularly**: VACUUM, ANALYZE, REINDEX as needed

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Establish baselines** - Record normal performance metrics
2. **Track trends** - Monitor daily/weekly patterns
3. **Set thresholds** - Define warning and critical levels
4. **Automate alerts** - Use monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
5. **Regular reviews** - Weekly performance analysis meetings
6. **Document changes** - Track configuration and schema modifications
7. **Capacity planning** - Monitor growth and forecast needs
8. **Test queries** - Validate optimizations in staging first

## InnoDB Memory Configuration

### Buffer Pool

```sql
-- Recommended: 70-80% of system RAM for dedicated MySQL server
-- For 16GB RAM server:
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_size = 12884901888;  -- 12GB

-- Check buffer pool usage
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_%';

-- Buffer pool hit ratio (target: >99%)
SELECT
    (1 - (Innodb_buffer_pool_reads / Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests)) * 100 as hit_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT
        VARIABLE_VALUE as Innodb_buffer_pool_reads
    FROM performance_schema.global_status
    WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'Innodb_buffer_pool_reads'
) reads,
(
    SELECT
        VARIABLE_VALUE as Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests
    FROM performance_schema.global_status
    WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests'
) requests;

-- Buffer pool instances (for multi-core systems)
-- Recommended: 1 instance per 1GB, max 64
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 8;
```

### Sort and Join Buffers

```sql
-- Sort buffer per connection
SET GLOBAL sort_buffer_size = 2097152;  -- 2MB

-- Join buffer for full joins
SET GLOBAL join_buffer_size = 2097152;  -- 2MB

-- Temporary table size
SET GLOBAL tmp_table_size = 67108864;  -- 64MB
SET GLOBAL max_heap_table_size = 67108864;  -- 64MB

-- Monitor temp table usage
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Created_tmp%';
```

## Query Cache (Deprecated in 8.0)

```sql
-- MySQL 5.7 and earlier
-- Note: Removed in MySQL 8.0
SET GLOBAL query_cache_type = 1;
SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 67108864;  -- 64MB

-- Check query cache effectiveness
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Qcache%';

-- Query cache hit ratio
SELECT
    Qcache_hits / (Qcache_hits + Com_select) * 100 as cache_hit_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE as Qcache_hits
    FROM performance_schema.global_status
    WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'Qcache_hits'
) hits,
(
    SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE as Com_select
    FROM performance_schema.global_status
    WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'Com_select'
) selects;
```

## InnoDB Performance Settings

### Log Files and Flushing

```sql
-- InnoDB log file size (larger = better write performance)
-- Recommended: 1-2GB for write-heavy workloads
SET GLOBAL innodb_log_file_size = 1073741824;  -- 1GB

-- Log buffer size
SET GLOBAL innodb_log_buffer_size = 16777216;  -- 16MB

-- Flush method (O_DIRECT for dedicated server, avoids double buffering)
-- Set in my.cnf
innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT

-- Flush log at transaction commit
-- 1 = full ACID (default, safest)
-- 2 = write to OS cache, flush every second
-- 0 = write and flush every second (fastest, risk data loss)
SET GLOBAL innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1;

-- For replication slaves or analytics (trade safety for speed)
SET GLOBAL innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2;
```

### I/O Configuration

```sql
-- Read I/O threads
SET GLOBAL innodb_read_io_threads = 8;

-- Write I/O threads
SET GLOBAL innodb_write_io_threads = 8;

-- I/O capacity (IOPS your storage can handle)
-- For SSD: 5000-20000
SET GLOBAL innodb_io_capacity = 10000;
SET GLOBAL innodb_io_capacity_max = 20000;

-- Flush method for optimal I/O
-- my.cnf:
innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
innodb_flush_neighbors = 0  -- Disable for SSD
```

### Thread Configuration

```sql
-- Max connections
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 200;

-- Thread cache (reuse threads)
SET GLOBAL thread_cache_size = 100;

-- Check thread cache effectiveness
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_%';
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Connections';

-- Thread cache hit ratio (target: >90%)
SELECT
    (1 - (Threads_created / Connections)) * 100 as thread_cache_hit_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE as Threads_created
    FROM performance_schema.global_status
    WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'Threads_created'
) created,
(
    SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE as Connections
    FROM performance_schema.global_status
    WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'Connections'
) conns;
```

## Query Optimization

### Slow Query Log

```sql
-- Enable slow query logging
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 1.0;  -- Log queries > 1 second
SET GLOBAL log_queries_not_using_indexes = 'ON';

-- Slow query log file location
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log_file = '/var/log/mysql/slow-query.log';

-- Analyze slow query log with pt-query-digest
-- $ pt-query-digest /var/log/mysql/slow-query.log

-- Check slow query status
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Slow_queries';
```

### Performance Schema

```sql
-- Enable performance schema (my.cnf)
performance_schema = ON

-- Top queries by total execution time
SELECT
    DIGEST_TEXT,
    COUNT_STAR as exec_count,
    ROUND(AVG_TIMER_WAIT / 1000000000000, 3) as avg_time_sec,
    ROUND(SUM_TIMER_WAIT / 1000000000000, 3) as total_time_sec,
    ROUND((SUM_TIMER_WAIT / SUM(SUM_TIMER_WAIT) OVER ()) * 100, 2) as pct
FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER BY SUM_TIMER_WAIT DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Full table scans
SELECT * FROM sys.statements_with_full_table_scans
ORDER BY exec_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Tables with high I/O
SELECT
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    count_read,
    count_write,
    count_fetch,
    SUM_TIMER_WAIT / 1000000000000 as total_latency_sec
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
WHERE object_schema NOT IN ('mysql', 'performance_schema', 'sys')
ORDER BY SUM_TIMER_WAIT DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Index Optimization

### Index Statistics

```sql
-- Update index statistics
ANALYZE TABLE users;

-- Check index cardinality
SHOW INDEX FROM users;

-- Find duplicate/redundant indexes
SELECT
    a.table_schema,
    a.table_name,
    a.index_name as index1,
    a.column_name,
    b.index_name as index2
FROM information_schema.statistics a
JOIN information_schema.statistics b
    ON a.table_schema = b.table_schema
    AND a.table_name = b.table_name
    AND a.seq_in_index = b.seq_in_index
    AND a.column_name = b.column_name
    AND a.index_name != b.index_name
WHERE a.table_schema NOT IN ('mysql', 'information_schema', 'performance_schema', 'sys')
ORDER BY a.table_schema, a.table_name, a.index_name;

-- Find unused indexes
SELECT
    object_schema,
    object_name,
    index_name
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE index_name IS NOT NULL
  AND count_star = 0
  AND object_schema NOT IN ('mysql', 'performance_schema', 'sys')
ORDER BY object_schema, object_name;
```

### Covering Indexes

```sql
-- Create covering index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_name_created
ON users(email, name, created_at);

-- Query can use covering index
EXPLAIN
SELECT name, created_at FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
-- Look for "Using index" in Extra column

-- Force index usage for testing
SELECT name FROM users FORCE INDEX (idx_users_email_name_created)
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## Partitioning

### Range Partitioning

```sql
-- Create partitioned table
CREATE TABLE events (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    data JSON,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(created_at)) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
    PARTITION p2025 VALUES LESS THAN (2026),
    PARTITION pmax VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);

-- Query with partition pruning
EXPLAIN PARTITIONS
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01' AND created_at < '2024-02-01';
-- Should show "partitions: p2024"

-- Add new partition
ALTER TABLE events
ADD PARTITION (PARTITION p2026 VALUES LESS THAN (2027));

-- Drop old partition (fast delete)
ALTER TABLE events DROP PARTITION p2023;
```

### List Partitioning

```sql
-- Partition by discrete values
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id BIGINT,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    PRIMARY KEY (id, status)
) PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(status) (
    PARTITION p_pending VALUES IN ('pending', 'processing'),
    PARTITION p_completed VALUES IN ('completed', 'shipped'),
    PARTITION p_cancelled VALUES IN ('cancelled', 'refunded')
);
```

## Replication Optimization

### Binary Log Settings

```sql
-- Binary log format
SET GLOBAL binlog_format = 'ROW';  -- ROW, STATEMENT, or MIXED

-- Binary log cache size
SET GLOBAL binlog_cache_size = 1048576;  -- 1MB per transaction

-- Sync binary log (durability vs performance)
SET GLOBAL sync_binlog = 1;  -- Safest, sync after each commit
-- sync_binlog = 0  -- Fastest, let OS handle flushing

-- Expire binary logs after N days
SET GLOBAL binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 604800;  -- 7 days
```

### Replication Lag Monitoring

```sql
-- On replica: Check replication lag
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G

-- Parse seconds behind master
SELECT
    IF(Slave_IO_Running = 'Yes' AND Slave_SQL_Running = 'Yes',
       Seconds_Behind_Master,
       NULL) as replication_lag_seconds
FROM (SHOW SLAVE STATUS) s;

-- Parallel replication (MySQL 8.0+)
SET GLOBAL slave_parallel_workers = 4;
SET GLOBAL slave_parallel_type = 'LOGICAL_CLOCK';
```

## Table Optimization

### Table Maintenance

```sql
-- Optimize table (rebuilds, reclaims space)
OPTIMIZE TABLE users;

-- Check table for errors
CHECK TABLE users;

-- Repair table if corrupted
REPAIR TABLE users;

-- Analyze table statistics
ANALYZE TABLE users;

-- Check fragmentation
SELECT
    table_schema,
    table_name,
    ROUND(data_length / 1024 / 1024, 2) as data_mb,
    ROUND(data_free / 1024 / 1024, 2) as free_mb,
    ROUND(data_free / data_length * 100, 2) as fragmentation_pct
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql', 'information_schema', 'performance_schema', 'sys')
  AND data_free > 0
ORDER BY fragmentation_pct DESC;
```

### Table Compression

```sql
-- InnoDB compression (requires ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED)
CREATE TABLE compressed_logs (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    message TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME
) ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8;

-- Check compression ratio
SELECT
    table_schema,
    table_name,
    ROUND(data_length / 1024 / 1024, 2) as data_mb,
    ROUND(index_length / 1024 / 1024, 2) as index_mb,
    create_options
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE row_format = 'Compressed';
```

## Memory Configuration

### Shared Buffers

```sql
-- Recommended: 25% of system RAM (up to 40% for dedicated DB server)
-- For 16GB RAM server:
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '4GB';

-- Check current setting
SHOW shared_buffers;

-- Monitor buffer hit ratio (target: >99%)
SELECT
    sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
    sum(heap_blks_hit) as heap_hit,

FROM pg_statio_user_tables;
```

### Work Memory

```sql
-- Per-operation memory for sorting/hashing
-- Recommended: (Total RAM * 0.25) / max_connections
-- For 16GB RAM, 100 connections: ~40MB
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '40MB';

-- Monitor sorts
SELECT
    query,
    calls,
    total_exec_time,
    mean_exec_time,
    min_exec_time,
    max_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%ORDER BY%' OR query LIKE '%GROUP BY%'
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Set per-session for large operations
SET work_mem = '256MB';
SELECT ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1000;
RESET work_mem;
```

### Maintenance Work Memory

```sql
-- For VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE
-- Recommended: 1-2GB for production systems
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '2GB';

-- Autovacuum workers use proportional amount
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_work_mem = '512MB';
```

### Effective Cache Size

```sql
-- Planner hint for available OS cache
-- Recommended: 50-75% of total RAM
-- For 16GB RAM:
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '12GB';
```

## Query Planner Settings

### Statistics Target

```sql
-- Default is 100, increase for better estimates on complex queries
ALTER SYSTEM SET default_statistics_target = 200;

-- Per-column statistics for specific columns
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET STATISTICS 500;

-- Force statistics update
ANALYZE users;

-- Check statistics quality
SELECT
    schemaname, tablename, attname,
    n_distinct, correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE tablename = 'users';
```

### Parallel Query Configuration

```sql
-- Enable parallel queries
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_parallel_workers = 8;
ALTER SYSTEM SET parallel_setup_cost = 100;
ALTER SYSTEM SET parallel_tuple_cost = 0.01;

-- Minimum rows to consider parallel execution
ALTER SYSTEM SET min_parallel_table_scan_size = '8MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET min_parallel_index_scan_size = '512kB';

-- Check if query uses parallel execution
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM large_table WHERE condition = 'value';
-- Look for "Parallel Seq Scan" or "Gather" nodes
```

### Join and Scan Methods

```sql
-- Enable all join methods (usually all enabled by default)
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_hashjoin = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_mergejoin = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_nestloop = on;

-- Cost parameters (adjust based on hardware)
ALTER SYSTEM SET random_page_cost = 1.1;  -- For SSD (default 4.0 is for HDD)
ALTER SYSTEM SET seq_page_cost = 1.0;

-- Disable methods for testing (don't do in production)
SET enable_seqscan = off;  -- Force index usage for testing
```

## Write Performance Optimization

### WAL Configuration

```sql
-- WAL write strategy
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_buffers = '16MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_writer_delay = '200ms';

-- Checkpoint configuration
ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_size = '2GB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET min_wal_size = '1GB';

-- Monitor checkpoints
SELECT
    checkpoints_timed,
    checkpoints_req,
    checkpoint_write_time,
    checkpoint_sync_time,
    buffers_checkpoint,
    buffers_clean,
    buffers_backend
FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;

-- Too many requested checkpoints = increase max_wal_size
```

### Commit Delays

```sql
-- Group commits (trade latency for throughput)
ALTER SYSTEM SET commit_delay = 10000;  -- 10ms
ALTER SYSTEM SET commit_siblings = 5;

-- Asynchronous commit (trade durability for speed)
-- Use cautiously - risk losing recent commits on crash
ALTER SYSTEM SET synchronous_commit = 'off';

-- Or per-transaction
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL synchronous_commit = 'off';
INSERT INTO logs (...) VALUES (...);
COMMIT;
```

## VACUUM and Autovacuum

### Autovacuum Configuration

```sql
-- Enable autovacuum (should always be on)
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum = on;

-- Autovacuum worker settings
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_max_workers = 4;
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_naptime = '30s';

-- Thresholds for triggering autovacuum
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.1;  -- 10% dead tuples
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50;

-- Analyze thresholds
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05;  -- 5% changed
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 50;

-- Per-table autovacuum settings for high-churn tables
ALTER TABLE busy_table SET (
    autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01,  -- More aggressive
    autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 2,       -- Faster vacuum
    autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 1000
);
```

### Manual Vacuum Operations

```sql
-- Full vacuum (locks table, reclaims space)
VACUUM FULL users;  -- Use sparingly, requires exclusive lock

-- Regular vacuum (non-locking)
VACUUM (ANALYZE, VERBOSE) users;

-- Check table bloat
SELECT
    schemaname, tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as table_size,
    n_dead_tup,
    n_live_tup,
    round(n_dead_tup * 100.0 / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 2) as dead_pct
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_live_tup > 0
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;

-- Monitor autovacuum activity
SELECT
    schemaname, relname,
    last_vacuum, last_autovacuum,
    last_analyze, last_autoanalyze,
    vacuum_count, autovacuum_count,
    analyze_count, autoanalyze_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY last_autovacuum DESC NULLS LAST;
```

## Connection Pooling

### Configuration

```sql
-- Max connections (keep reasonable to manage memory)
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 200;

-- Reserved connections for superuser
ALTER SYSTEM SET superuser_reserved_connections = 3;

-- Connection lifecycle
ALTER SYSTEM SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '5min';
ALTER SYSTEM SET statement_timeout = '30s';  -- Per-query timeout

-- Monitor connections
SELECT
    state,
    count(*),
    max(now() - state_change) as max_idle_time
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY state;

-- Find long-running queries
SELECT
    pid,
    now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration,
    query,
    state
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 minutes'
  AND state != 'idle';
```

## Lock Management

### Lock Monitoring

```sql
-- Check current locks
SELECT
    locktype,
    relation::regclass,
    mode,
    granted,
    pid,
    pg_blocking_pids(pid) as blocked_by

```

## Partitioning

### Range Partitioning

```sql
-- Create partitioned table
CREATE TABLE events (
    id BIGSERIAL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    data JSONB
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE events_2024_01 PARTITION OF events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE events_2024_02 PARTITION OF events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');

-- Create indexes on partitions
CREATE INDEX idx_events_2024_01_type ON events_2024_01(event_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_2024_02_type ON events_2024_02(event_type);

-- Query uses partition pruning
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-15' AND created_at < '2024-01-20';
-- Should show "Partitions pruned: X"
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics Queries

```sql
-- pg_stat_statements (install extension first)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;

-- Top slow queries
SELECT
    round(total_exec_time::numeric, 2) as total_time,
    calls,
    round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as mean_time,
    round((100 * total_exec_time / sum(total_exec_time) OVER ())::numeric, 2) as pct,
    query
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Cache hit ratio by table
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    heap_blks_hit,
    heap_blks_read,
    round(100.0 * heap_blks_hit / NULLIF(heap_blks_hit + heap_blks_read, 0), 2) as cache_hit_pct
FROM pg_statio_user_tables
WHERE heap_blks_hit + heap_blks_read > 0
ORDER BY heap_blks_read DESC;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

## Execution Plan Analysis

### PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE

```sql
-- Get actual execution statistics
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE, TIMING)
SELECT u.id, u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 5;

-- Key metrics to examine:
-- 1. Actual time vs Planning time
-- 2. Rows estimate vs Actual rows (cardinality)
-- 3. Buffers (shared hits vs reads)
-- 4. Sequential Scans vs Index Scans
-- 5. Join methods (Nested Loop, Hash Join, Merge Join)
```

### MySQL EXPLAIN

```sql
-- Basic execution plan
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE user_id = 123 AND status = 'pending';

-- JSON format for detailed analysis
EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON
SELECT u.name, o.total
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- Analyze actual execution (MySQL 8.0+)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category_id = 5
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Query Rewriting Patterns

### Eliminate Subqueries

```sql
-- BEFORE (Slow - executes subquery for each row)
SELECT *
FROM orders o
WHERE total > (
    SELECT AVG(total)
    FROM orders
    WHERE user_id = o.user_id
);

-- AFTER (Fast - single join with window function)
WITH user_averages AS (
    SELECT user_id, AVG(total) as avg_total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT o.*
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN user_averages ua ON o.user_id = ua.user_id
WHERE o.total > ua.avg_total;
```

### Optimize JOIN Order

```sql
-- BEFORE (Cartesian product then filter)
SELECT p.name, c.name, s.stock
FROM products p, categories c, stock s
WHERE p.category_id = c.id
  AND p.id = s.product_id
  AND c.active = true;

-- AFTER (Filter first, then join)
SELECT p.name, c.name, s.stock
FROM categories c
INNER JOIN products p ON p.category_id = c.id
INNER JOIN stock s ON s.product_id = p.id
WHERE c.active = true;
```

### Use EXISTS Instead of IN

```sql
-- BEFORE (Slow - materializes entire subquery)
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE total > 1000
);

-- AFTER (Fast - short-circuits on first match)
SELECT * FROM users u
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o
    WHERE o.user_id = u.id
    AND o.total > 1000
);
```

### Optimize DISTINCT

```sql
-- BEFORE (Sorts entire result set)
SELECT DISTINCT u.email
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed';

-- AFTER (Uses index for uniqueness)
SELECT u.email
FROM users u
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o
    WHERE o.user_id = u.id
    AND o.status = 'completed'
);
```

## CTE Optimization

### Materialized vs Inline CTEs

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Force materialization for reuse
WITH expensive_calculation AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT user_id,
           SUM(total) as lifetime_value,
           COUNT(*) as order_count
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT *
FROM expensive_calculation
WHERE lifetime_value > 10000
   OR order_count > 50;

-- Force inline for single-use CTEs
WITH recent_users AS NOT MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT id FROM users
    WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
SELECT * FROM recent_users;
```

## Window Function Optimization

```sql
-- BEFORE (Multiple subqueries)
SELECT
    o.id,
    o.total,
    (SELECT MAX(total) FROM orders WHERE user_id = o.user_id) as max_total,
    (SELECT AVG(total) FROM orders WHERE user_id = o.user_id) as avg_total
FROM orders o;

-- AFTER (Single window function scan)
SELECT
    id,
    total,
    MAX(total) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) as max_total,
    AVG(total) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) as avg_total
FROM orders;
```

## Aggregation Strategies

### Partial Aggregation

```sql
-- For large cardinality groups, pre-aggregate
WITH daily_stats AS (
    SELECT
        DATE(created_at) as day,
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) as daily_orders,
        SUM(total) as daily_total
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
    GROUP BY DATE(created_at), user_id
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    SUM(daily_orders) as total_orders,
    AVG(daily_total) as avg_daily_total
FROM daily_stats
GROUP BY user_id;
```

## Pagination Optimization

```sql
-- BEFORE (Slow on large offsets)
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10000;

-- AFTER (Keyset pagination - cursor-based)
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE created_at < '2024-01-01 12:00:00'
   OR (created_at = '2024-01-01 12:00:00' AND id < 12345)
ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Create index for keyset pagination
CREATE INDEX idx_products_pagination
ON products (created_at DESC, id DESC);
```

## Query Pattern Red Flags

| Pattern | Issue | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `SELECT *` | Fetches unnecessary columns | Select only needed columns |
| `OR` conditions | Prevents index usage | Use UNION or separate queries |
| `LIKE '%term%'` | Full table scan | Use full-text search or trigram indexes |
| `WHERE DATE(column) = ...` | Function prevents index usage | Use range: `column >= '2024-01-01' AND column < '2024-01-02'` |
| Large `IN` lists | Inefficient for >100 items | Use temporary table or JOIN |
| Implicit type conversion | Prevents index usage | Match column data types exactly |

## Performance Validation

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Compare query performance
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
-- your query here

-- Check buffer cache hits
SELECT
    sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
    sum(heap_blks_hit) as heap_hit,
    sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;

-- MySQL: Check handler statistics
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Handler%';
FLUSH STATUS;
-- run your query
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Handler%';
```
