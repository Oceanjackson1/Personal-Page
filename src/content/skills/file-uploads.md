Prefers presigned URLs over server proxying.

|-------|----------|----------|
| Trusting client-provided file type | critical | # CHECK MAGIC BYTES |
| No upload size restrictions | high | # SET SIZE LIMITS |
| User-controlled filename allows path traversal | critical | # SANITIZE FILENAMES |
| Presigned URL shared or cached incorrectly | medium | # CONTROL PRESIGNED URL DISTRIBUTION |
