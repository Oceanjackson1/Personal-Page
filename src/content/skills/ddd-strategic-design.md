# DDD Strategic Design

## Use this skill when

- Defining core, supporting, and generic subdomains.
- Splitting a monolith or service landscape by domain boundaries.
- Aligning teams and ownership with bounded contexts.
- Building a shared ubiquitous language with domain experts.

## Do not use this skill when

- The domain model is stable and already well bounded.
- You need tactical code patterns only.
- The task is purely infrastructure or UI oriented.

## Instructions

1. Extract domain capabilities and classify subdomains.
2. Define bounded contexts around consistency and ownership.
3. Establish a ubiquitous language glossary and anti-terms.
4. Capture context boundaries in ADRs before implementation.

If detailed templates are needed, open `references/strategic-design-template.md`.

## Required artifacts

- Subdomain classification table
- Bounded context catalog
- Glossary with canonical terms
- Boundary decisions with rationale

## Examples

```text
Use @ddd-strategic-design to map our commerce domain into bounded contexts,
classify subdomains, and propose team ownership.
```

## Limitations

- This skill does not produce executable code.
- It cannot infer business truth without stakeholder input.
- It should be followed by tactical design before implementation.

# Strategic Design Template

## Subdomain classification

| Capability | Subdomain type | Why | Owner team |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pricing | Core | Differentiates business value | Commerce |
| Identity | Supporting | Needed but not differentiating | Platform |

## Bounded context catalog

| Context | Responsibility | Upstream dependencies | Downstream consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog | Product data lifecycle | Supplier feed | Checkout, Search |
| Checkout | Order placement and payment authorization | Catalog, Pricing | Fulfillment, Billing |

## Ubiquitous language

| Term | Definition | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Order | Confirmed purchase request | Checkout |
| Reservation | Temporary inventory hold | Fulfillment |
